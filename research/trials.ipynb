In addition to full essays on\\nalternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatment sections for diseases and condi-\\ntions that may be helped by complementary therapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-\\nments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,\\nincluding professional medical guides and textbooks as\\nwell as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general\\nadvisory board, made up of public librarians, medical\\nlibrarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-\\nics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted\\nby category and sent to GEM2 medical advisors, certified\\nphysicians with various medical specialities, for review.\\nFinal selection of topics to include was made by the med-\\nical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and\\nother health care professionals. GEM2 medical advisors\\nreviewed the completed essays to insure that they are\\nappropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\n• Straight alphabetical arrangement allows users to\\nlocate information quickly.\\n• Bold-faced terms function as print hyperlinks that\\npoint the reader to related entries in the encyclopedia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 IX\\nINTRODUCTION'),\n",

A transmit-\\nter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs to\\nproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\\n“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is\\nparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the\\nsonar technology developed to detect submarines during\\nWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-\\nduced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-\\nty had improved to the point that it came into general\\nmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-\\ntion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low\\ncost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the\\ntop drawer of medical imaging techniques.\\nWhile pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal\\nimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-\\nnologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing\\nradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than\\nplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft\\ntissue structures, and can be used in any of several\\nmodes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally\\nis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute\\nabdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-\\npected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-\\ncreatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-\\nease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal\\naortic aneurysm. Specifically:\\n• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or\\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound\\nscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-\\ntial causes when presented with general or ambiguous\\nsymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be\\nstudied for signs of disease that appear as changes in\\nsize, shape and internal structure.\\n• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a\\ncar crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as an\\ninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and it\\ncan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severity\\nof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds,f r o m\\na bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreign\\nobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.\\nThe easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-\\nnology has brought it into common emergency room\\nuse, and even into limited ambulance service.\\n• Abdominal mass.

In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be\\ndistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and\\nabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ or\\npart of the abdomen can be found.\\n• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver\\ndisease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a\\ngeneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between\\nmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, and\\nis particularly good at identifying obstruction of the\\nbile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by\\nabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.\\n• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of\\nthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as are\\npancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt proper\\nfunctioning.\\n• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi can\\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and also\\nobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-\\nstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well to\\nultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic\\ninjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,\\nwhich can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-\\nsoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct\\nchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-\\nplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven\\nextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. These\\naneurysms are relatively common and increase in\\nprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-\\nnently life-threatening. However, they can be readily\\nidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acute\\ncomplications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\\nsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placement\\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications for\\nultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies\\nin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just like\\naudible sound, and vibrate the materials through which\\nthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-\\nable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.\\nProperly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound can\\nbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated\\nscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-\\nmote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-\\nly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound can\\nalso be used to physically destroy certain types of\\ntumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.\\nDeveloping new treatment applications for ultrasound is\\nan active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually\\nwithout risk or side effects. Some patients report feeling\\na slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, but\\nmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriate\\nfrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-\\nvate any medical condition, though any woman who\\nthinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue with\\nher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equipment\\nused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.\\nImproperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound can\\nbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem exists\\nwhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-\\ntion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-\\nsive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment can\\nperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patients\\nshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-\\ncians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as the\\nquality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-\\nposed procedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,\\npatients should educate themselves about the proposed\\nprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-\\nate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominal\\nultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may be\\nhampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, such\\nas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaque\\nto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are often\\nnot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-\\nquency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, or\\ncycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-\\nquencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 22\\nAbdominal ultrasound\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2'),\n",

In\\nany case, their presence points to an underlying\\nabnormality in the parent organ.\\nBenign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is\\nstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy—The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-\\nsue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the\\nterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissue\\nfrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus —Any type of hard concretion (stone) in\\nthe body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-\\ncreas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-\\nlation of excess mineral salts and other organic\\nmaterial such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can\\ncause problems by lodging in and obstructing the\\nproper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines or\\nurine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-\\ntion of proper functioning—jaundice is often an\\naccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include\\nalcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-\\ntive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct —The branching passage\\nthrough which bile—a necessary digestive\\nenzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder into\\nthe small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the\\npancreas also enter the intestines through the com-\\nmon bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special-\\nized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused\\nand relatively low energy radiation to produce\\ndetailed two-dimensional images of soft tissue\\nstructures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the\\nchief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higher\\nquality images not disrupted by bone or gas. They\\nare, however, more cumbersome, time consuming\\nand expensive to perform, and they use ionizing\\nelectromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returning\\nto a stationary source from a moving target. If the\\nobject is moving toward the source, the frequency\\nincreases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-\\ncy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can be\\nused to compute the object’s speed—be it a car on\\nthe road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effect\\nholds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.\\nFrequency—Sound, whether traveling through air\\nor the human body, produces vibrations—mole-\\ncules bouncing into each other—as the shock wave\\ntravels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-\\nber of vibrations per second. Within the audible\\nrange, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-\\nquency, the higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individual\\ncells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear\\nradiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—are\\npotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate\\nthe material through which they pass, but do not\\nionize it.\\nJaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint\\nto the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in\\nthe liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate\\ncause, but the underlying cause could be as simple\\nas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-\\nstone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound\\ncan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant—The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for\\ncancerous and connotes a harmful condition that\\ngenerally is life-threatening.\\nMorphology—Literally, the study of form.

Abdominal\\nultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies\\nbetween 2-5 MHz.\\nAn ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the\\ntransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces\\nthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives the\\nreflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-\\ntric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity that\\nis produced when you put pressure on certain crystals\\nsuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-\\nes by producing sound waves ( they are transmitting\\nwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electric\\npulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-\\nes supplied to the transducer causes it to produce the\\nscanning sound waves. The transducer then receives the\\nreturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses\\nand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-\\nnizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles per\\nhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to be\\nreceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into the\\nbody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the\\nspecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can be\\nplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, the\\nechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surrounded\\nby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines and\\nbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because the\\nwaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in med-\\nical imaging:\\n• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the body\\nwith the echoes plotted on screen as a function of\\ndepth. This method is used to measure distances within\\nthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeutic\\nultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also\\nA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the\\ndestructive wave energy.\\n• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-\\nducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body\\nthat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on\\nscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100\\ntransducers in sequence form the basis for these most\\ncommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.\\n• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence\\nof B-mode scans whose images follow each other in\\nsequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-\\nsure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that\\nproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-\\nmode ultrasound has been put to particular use in\\nstudying heart motion.\\n• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of moving\\nmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-\\nciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measure\\nthe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability is\\nmost often combined with B-mode scanning to produce\\nimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can be\\ndirectly measured. This technique is used extensively to\\ninvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-\\ntension, particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-\\ninal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. These\\nmachines cost about $250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless of\\nthe type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight\\nhours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach is\\nempty and as small as possible, and that the intestines\\nand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows the\\ngall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating and\\nmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a\\nfull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the way\\nso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.\\nThe patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gel\\nthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across the\\nskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating the\\nequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen to\\nobtain different views of the target areas. The patient will\\nlikely be asked to change positions from side to side and\\nto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desired\\nviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technology\\nmakes it difficult to generalize about the time and costs\\ninvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-\\ncious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aortic\\naneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform and\\nwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending on\\nthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-\\ntors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-mode\\nand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targets\\nnot well defined in advance, generally take more time\\nand are more expensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and\\nless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

Sensitive tissues, par-\\nticularly those of the reproductive organs, could possibly\\nsustain damage if violently vibrated by overly intense\\nultrasound waves. In general though, such damage would\\nonly result from improper use of the equipment.\\nAny woman who thinks she might be pregnant\\nshould raise this issue with her doctor before undergoing\\nan abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early stages of\\ndevelopment could be injured by ultrasound meant to\\nprobe deeply recessed abdominal organs.\\nNormal results\\nAs a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal abdom-\\ninal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence of the\\nsuspected condition that prompted the scan. For example,\\nsymptoms such as a persistent cough, labored breathing,\\nand upper abdominal pain suggest the possibility of,\\namong other things, an abdominal aortic aneurysm. An\\nultrasound scan that indicates the absence of an aneurysm\\nwould rule out this life-threatening condition and point to\\nother, less serious causes.\\nAbnormal results\\nBecause abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally\\nundertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the results\\nof a scan often will prove abnormal—that is they will\\nconfirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis of\\nthe liver or an aortic aneurysm.

The\\nstomach and intestines begin development outside the\\nbaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wall\\nenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical opening\\nis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-\\nels or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through the\\nabdominal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes for birth defects that still\\nremain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal wall\\ndefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother may\\nhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus\\nare nondescript.\\nDiagnosis\\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of\\nthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worse\\ncases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, an\\nultrasound examination may detect the problem. It is\\nalways necessary in children with one birth defect to look\\nfor others, because birth defects are usually multiple.\\nTreatment\\nAbdominal wall defects are effectively treated with\\nsurgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-\\nalies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.\\nThe organs are normal, just misplaced. However, if the\\ndefect is large, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera into\\nthe small abdominal cavity.\\nPrognosis\\nIf there are no other defects, the prognosis after sur-\\ngical repair of this condition is relatively good.

After surgery, increased pressure in\\nthe stretched abdomen can compromise the function of\\nthe organs inside.\\nPrevention\\nSome, but by no means all, birth defects are pre-\\nventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good nutri-\\ntion, supplemental vitamins , diligent avoidance of all\\nunnecessary drugs and chemicals—especially tobacco—\\nand other elements of a healthy lifestyle.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nDunn, J.

Although D&X is high-\\nly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-\\ntages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-\\nstances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus is\\nremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.\\nIntact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower risk\\nof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Another\\nperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancy\\nwithout requiring the woman to go through labor, which\\nmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of\\nlate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lower\\ncost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-\\nversy common to all late-term abortions is whether the\\nfetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s\\nbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that\\nfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal\\nbody has exited the uterus. Several states have taken\\nlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians\\nwho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may\\nrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-\\ning late-term abortion.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves\\nadministration of medications to cause the cervix to\\ndilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, the\\nphysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.\\nThe body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet\\nfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,\\nthe physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of\\nthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the\\ncontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,\\nwhich results in the death of the fetus, and reduces the\\nsizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through\\nthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is then\\nremoved from the woman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient\\nvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria ,t o\\ncause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local\\nlegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,\\ncounseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewing\\nstages of fetal development, childbirth, alternative abor-\\ntion methods, and adoption.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech —A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest\\nthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exit\\nthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the last\\npart to exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria —A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed near\\nthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-\\ntal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to\\nmonitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion\\nis performed, the more complicated the procedure and\\nthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to\\nassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of\\ninjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood\\nclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,\\nand anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk\\nof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not\\ndead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible\\nlong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or\\ncarrying a future pregnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination of\\na pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nEpner, Janet E., et al. “Late-term Abortion.”JAMA 280, no. 8\\n(26 August 1998): 724-729.\\nSprang, M.

Dugan, M.S.\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a\\nmulti-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to the\\nmother in carrying and giving birth to more than one or\\ntwo babies, and also to decrease the risk of complications\\nto the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortion\\nalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such as\\nthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be born\\nwith some birth defect or impairment, or because the sex\\nof the fetus is not preferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons, for\\nexample, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-\\nnancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended often in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more than\\none fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In the\\ngeneral population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only\\nabout 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-\\ncies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-\\nble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-\\nable with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-\\nfetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-\\nment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetal\\npregnancy and consider the prospect of recommended\\nreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful\\nwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-\\ndure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-\\ndle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina and\\npotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction to\\nsafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled\\nprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-\\nmation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to\\nboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks\\nafter the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it be\\nbecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the\\nfetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel\\nguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental\\nhealth professionals should be consulted throughout the\\nprocess.\\nRisks\\nAbout 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-\\ntion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of\\nwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one\\nor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated\\nwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.\\nNormal results\\nIn cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or\\nmore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically\\ndevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKnobil, Ernst and Jimmy D.

Women\\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy would\\ncause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or\\nbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be\\nborn with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the first\\nsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-\\nculation of this date is referred to as the gestational age\\nand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. For\\nexample, a woman who is two weeks late having her\\nperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is six\\nweeks since she last menstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.\\nAbortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higher\\nKEY TERMS\\nMulti-fetal pregnancy —A pregnancy of two or\\nmore fetuses.\\nSelective reduction—Typically referred to in cases\\nof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetuses\\nare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-\\ning fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.\\nrate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are\\nextremely rare and are usually limited to situations where\\nthe life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics or\\noutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early in\\npregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlled\\nepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who\\nare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatients\\nif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-\\nvious endocarditis, asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter-\\nine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-\\ntrolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually\\nneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-\\ntoring and medications during the procedure.\\nDescription\\nV ery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This\\nprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,\\nmini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of the\\nuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic\\ntube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suction\\nis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the “morning after” pill, or\\nemergency contraception . Basically, it involves taking\\nhigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours of\\nhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormones\\ncauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-\\nport a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it is\\nsimply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, and\\nuses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type is\\navailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-\\nven. But women can even use their regular birth control\\npills for emergency contraception, after they check with\\ntheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of women\\nwho use birth control pills for emergency contraception\\nget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts the\\nrisk of pregnancy 75 percent.\\nThe other type of morning-after pill contains only\\none hormone: progestin, and is available under the brand\\nname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type with\\na lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the risk\\nof pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians regard-\\ning the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9'),\n",

This results in an incomplete\\nabortion that means the pregnancy continues.\\nFirst trimester abortions\\nThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13\\nweeks after the last menstrual period. In the United\\nStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during this\\nperiod. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,\\nand the time in which women have the most choice of\\nhow the procedure is performed.\\nMEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are brought\\nabout by taking medications that end the pregnancy. The\\nadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:\\n• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments\\nare used.\\n• Anesthesia is not required.\\n• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.\\n• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.\\nDisadvantages of a medical abortion are:\\n• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.\\n• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-\\ngical abortion.\\n• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is\\nexpelled.\\nTwo different medications can be used to bring about\\nan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-\\nping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, about\\na week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an\\noxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for\\nvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction\\n(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the\\nuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the\\ncontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-\\nup visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the\\nabortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This\\ncombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending\\npregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-\\nesterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,\\nthen stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the\\npregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the\\nfirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to\\nthe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days\\nlater she returns and, if the miscarriage has not\\noccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the\\nuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to\\ntake misoprostol. After an observation period, she\\nreturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled the\\ncontents of their uterus and completed the abortion.\\nWithin 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the\\nabortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-\\nsary to confirm through observation or ultrasound that\\nthe procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, a\\nsurgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8\\npercent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion\\nafter taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in\\nabout 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortion\\nis recommended because the fetus may be damanged.\\nSide effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy\\ncramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor-\\nmal period and may last up to 16 days.\\nMifepristone is not recommended for women with\\nectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 210\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nUterus\\nEmbryonic\\ntissue\\nVagina Vulsellum\\nCervix\\nSpeculum\\nExtraction tube\\nBetween 5 and 7 weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a pro-\\ncedure called menstrual extraction.The contents of the\\nuterus are suctioned out through a thin extraction tube that\\nis inserted through the undilated cervix.

The procedure is also called\\ndilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-\\num curettage, or suction curettage.\\nAdvantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:\\n• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.\\n• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.\\n• The woman does not see the products of her womb\\nbeing removed.\\nDisadvantages include:\\n• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.\\n• Infection may occur.\\nDuring a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is\\ngradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into the\\ncervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-\\ntion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-\\ntents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is\\n97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a woman\\nfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is often\\ngiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterine\\ncramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman may\\nreturn home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during the\\nfirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may be\\ninevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not\\navailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especially\\nteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come to\\nterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a first\\ntrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-\\ning second trimester abortions.\\nSome second trimester abortions are performed as a\\nD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in the\\nfirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be used\\nbecause more material must be removed. This increases\\nthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increases\\nthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctant\\nto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for some\\nwomen is it not a medically safe option.\\nThe alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is\\nan abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may require\\nan overnight stay in a hospital.

This prevents blood incompatibility complications\\nin future pregnancies.\\nBleeding will continue for about five days in a surgical\\nabortion and longer in a medical abortion. To decrease the\\nrisk of infection, a woman should avoid intercourse and not\\nuse tampons and douches for two weeks after the abortion.\\nA follow-up visit is a necessary part of the woman’s\\naftercare. Contraception will be offered to women who\\nwish to avoid future pregnancies, because menstrual\\nperiods normally resume within a few weeks.\\nRisks\\nSerious complications resulting from abortions per-\\nformed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of women\\nwho have abortions in this time period, 2.5% have minor\\ncomplications that can be handled without hospitaliza-\\ntion. Less than 0.5% have complications that require a\\nhospital stay. The rate of complications increases as the\\npregnancy progresses.\\nComplications from abortions can include:\\n• uncontrolled bleeding\\n• infection\\n• blood clots accumulating in the uterus\\n• a tear in the cervix or uterus\\n• missed abortion where the pregnancy continues\\n• incomplete abortion where some material from the\\npregnancy remains in the uterus\\nWomen who experience any of the following symp-\\ntoms of post-abortion complications should call the clin-\\nic or doctor who performed the abortion immediately.\\n• severe pain\\n• fever over 100.4°F (38.2°C)\\n• heavy bleeding that soaks through more than one sani-\\ntary pad per hour\\n• foul-smelling discharge from the vagina\\n• continuing symptoms of pregnancy\\nNormal results\\nUsually the pregnancy is ended without complica-\\ntion and without altering future fertility.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

Septic abscesses can occur any-\\nwhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune\\nresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,\\nwhite blood cells gather at the infected site and begin\\nproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ\\nby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the\\ngerms and breaking them down into small pieces that can\\nbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the\\nbody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body\\ntissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-\\ning digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,\\nand enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, as\\nthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,\\nseveral events occur:\\n• Blood flow to the area increases.\\n• The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,\\nand other liquids.\\n• It turns red.\\n• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and\\nthe chemical activity.\\nThese four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—\\ncharacterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an\\nabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies\\nmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-\\nlows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easily\\ndigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath the\\nskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skin\\nrather than working its way through the skin where it\\ncould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscess\\nalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-\\ntoms just like any other infection. These include chills,\\nfever, aching, and general discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\\nsame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-\\ntants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin is\\nnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and may\\ncause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—\\nsterile because there is no infection involved. Sterile\\nabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps as\\nthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like\\nStaphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the cause\\nof abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the large\\nbowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused by\\nany of the numerous bacteria found within the large\\nbowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be caused\\nby any organism that can travel there through the circula-\\ntion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel in\\nthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body are\\ncaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-\\ntures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-\\nic abscesses are:\\n• skin abscesses by normal skin flora\\n• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora\\n• lung abscesses by normal airway flora, pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n• Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceous\\nglands) on the back or the back of the neck are the ones\\nusually infected. The most common germ involved is\\nStaphylococcus aureus . Acne is a similar condition of\\nsebaceous glands on the face and back.\\n• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a\\ntiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac-\\nteria can enter this opening, causing an infection and\\nsubsequent abscess.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 13\\nAbcess\\nAn amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica.\\n(Phototake NYC.

Pain\\nand tenderness on physical examination are common\\nfindings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-\\nnel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterile\\nabscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-\\ntock where a shot was given.\\nTreatment\\nSince skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,\\nit acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals of\\nan abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,\\nthe pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.\\nThe surgeon determines when the abscess is ready for\\ndrainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing the\\npus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaining\\ninfection, sometimes with the help of antibiotics or other\\ndrugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth or\\nrubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closing\\nbefore all the pus has drained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is more\\nrapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals\\nwork faster at higher temperatures, applications of hot\\ncompresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten the\\ndigestion of the skin and eventually result in its breaking\\ndown, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment is\\nbest reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-\\ngerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.\\nIt is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their very\\nearly stages.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-\\nous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive and\\nwrongful misuse of anything. There are several major types\\nof abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,\\nsubstance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by\\nan other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-\\ning, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.\\nThe physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in\\nbruises , burns, poisoning , broken bones, and internal\\nhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily\\noccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-\\nlence. It is estimated that approximately three million\\nchildren witness domestic violence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children, one\\nof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual\\nbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-\\ntocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also\\ninclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-\\ntion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography is also used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\\nmale. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care\\nsettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a\\nfemale with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-\\nfathers is five times more common than with biological\\nfathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or\\nfathers is the most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-\\ntration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-\\ntion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-\\ntration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:\\n• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use\\nof drugs).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 216\\nAbuse\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 16'),\n",

The\\ncriteria include one or more of the following occurring\\nwithin a 12-month period:\\n• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill\\nobligations at home, work, or school.\\n• using substance in situations that are physically danger-\\nous (i.e., while driving).\\n• recurrent substance-related legal problems.\\n• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-\\nsonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-\\ncant other).\\nAbuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly\\nas a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level of\\ndependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abuse\\ncan be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delaying\\nor not reporting the need for advanced medical care.\\nElderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (money\\nor possessions taken away) and abandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after phys-\\nical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personally\\ntailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-\\nit a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a variety\\nof symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, and\\npsychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-\\ncally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,\\ndepressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, they\\nexhibit fear,anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychological\\nproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic\\nstress disorder. Physically abused children may complain\\nof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\\nmay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-\\ndren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual\\nbehavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.\\nAdolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,\\nand—in some situations—homosexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately\\nlead to death. Approximately 50% of women murdered\\nin the United States were killed by a former or current\\nmale partner. Approximately one-third of emergency\\nroom consultations by women were prompted due to\\ndomestic violence. Female victims who are married also\\nhave a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-\\nKEY TERMS\\nEncopresis—Abnormalities relating to bowel move-\\nments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.\\nness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).\\nPhysical abuse or rape can also occur between married\\npersons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-\\nally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and\\ndebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-\\nlence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-\\nually assaulted persons were also physically abused in the\\nform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with\\na weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who are\\nhurt and humiliated tend to physical assault persons\\nwhom they are intimately involved with, such as spouses\\nand/or children. Males who assault a female tend to have\\nexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.\\nThey also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,\\nand are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directed\\nagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor the\\nwomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolate\\nother sources of protection and support. They interpret\\ntheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-\\nment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-\\ning control. Males may also use aggression against\\nfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly\\ncommunity. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-\\ntaker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-\\ning behavioral changes in the elderly person when the\\ncaretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can be\\npossible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,\\ninconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack of\\nhygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who are victims of domestic violence are\\nfrequently injured attempting to protect their mother\\nfrom an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspection\\nor self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also be\\nevident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises or\\nself report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can be\\nassessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator.\\nEjaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth,\\nrectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis-\\neases may be performed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 17\\nAbuse\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 17'),\n",

No more\\nthan 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.\\nBecause the drug can potentially harm the liver, people\\nwho drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-\\nerably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the\\ndrug completely.\\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-\\n300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physician\\nfor dosages for children under age 6 years.\\nPrecautions\\nNever take more than the recommended dosage of\\nacetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician or\\ndentist.\\nPatients should not use acetaminophen for more than\\n10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for more\\nthan 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by a\\nphysician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they get\\nworse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three or\\nmore alcoholic beverages a day should check with a\\nphysician before using this drug and should never take\\nmore than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam-\\nage exists from combining large amounts of alcohol and\\nacetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liver\\ndisease or liver infections should also consult with a\\nphysician before using the drug. So should women who\\nare pregnant or breastfeeding.\\nSmoking cigarettes may interfere with the effective-\\nness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higher\\ndoses of the medicine, but should not take more than the\\nrecommended daily dosage unless told by a physician to\\ndo so.\\nKEY TERMS\\nArthritis —Inflammation of the joints. The condi-\\ntion causes pain and swelling.\\nFatigue—Physical or mental weariness.\\nInflammation—A response to irritation, infection,\\nor injury, resulting in pain, redness, and swelling.\\nMany drugs can interact with one another. Consult\\na physician or pharmacist before combining aceta-\\nminophen with any other medicine. Do not use two\\ndifferent acetaminophen-containing products at the\\nsame time.\\nAcetaminophen interferes with the results of some\\nmedical tests. Before having medical tests done, check to\\nsee whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results.\\nAvoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may be\\nnecessary.\\nSide effects\\nAcetaminophen causes few side effects. The most\\ncommon one is lightheadedness. Some people may\\nexperience trembling and pain in the side or the lower\\nback. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, but\\nthey are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such as\\na rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after taking\\nacetaminophen should stop taking the drug and get\\nimmediate medical attention. Other rare side effects\\ninclude yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-\\ning, weakness, fatigue , bloody or black stools, bloody\\nor cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amount\\nof urine.\\nOverdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,\\nvomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large overdoses\\ncan cause liver damage. In case of an overdose, get\\nimmediate medical attention.\\nInteractions\\nAcetaminophen may interact with a variety of other\\nmedicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both\\nof the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may\\nbe greater. Among the drugs that may interact with\\nacetaminophen are alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin, oral contra-\\nceptives, the antiseizure drug phenytoin (Dilantin), the\\nblood-thinning drug warfarin (Coumadin), the choles-\\nterol-lowering drug cholestyramine (Questran), the\\nantibiotic Isoniazid, and zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 19\\nAcetaminophen\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 19'),\n",

A ring of muscle called the lower esophageal\\nsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance to\\nthe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contracted\\nto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, the\\ncontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-\\ngus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-\\ntate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as\\nheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushes\\nfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the\\nesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-\\nach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” the\\nesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-\\nsis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax the\\nesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-\\nation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-\\ntion is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-\\nmon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-\\nally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,\\noften feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. The\\nperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina\\npectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belching\\nare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other\\nsymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent\\npneumoniacaused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical\\nhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-\\ntoms and on eliminating other medical conditions that\\nmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnose\\nachalasia include:\\n• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressure\\nexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of\\nthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to\\nsee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is\\nused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.\\nThis test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms\\nlike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-\\ntion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-\\nloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and\\ninflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effective\\nin about 70% of patients.\\nThree other treatments are used for achalasia when\\nballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.\\n• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,\\nbotulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it to\\nrelax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.\\n• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the\\nsphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.\\nEsophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with the\\ndevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdom-\\ninal incisions.\\n• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,\\nreduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-\\nvides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as long\\nas two years.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with achalasia can be treated effective-\\nly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unless\\nesophageal carcinoma develops.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 220\\nAchalasia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 20'),\n",

The disorder appears in approxi-\\nmately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia is\\nusually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristic\\nappearance of the newborn.\\nNormal bone growth depends on the production of\\ncartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-\\num is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-\\nen and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities\\nof this process prevent the bones (especially those in\\nthe limbs) from growing as long as they normally\\nshould, at the same time allowing the bones to become\\nabnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the\\nbody and the skull are mostly not affected, although the\\nopening from the skull through which the spinal cord\\npasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-\\nmal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which the\\nspinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes\\nincreasingly and abnormally small down the length of\\nthe spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a\\ndominant trait, meaning that anybody with the genetic\\ndefect will display all the symptoms of the disorder.

Although achondroplasia can be\\npassed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of cases\\noccur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-\\ningly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one of\\nonly a few defects known to increase in frequency with\\nincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects are\\nlinked to increased age of the mother).\\nPeople with achondroplasia have abnormally short\\narms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as is\\ntheir head. The appearance of short limbs and normal\\nhead size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.\\nThe bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-\\nance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-\\nmal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays an\\noverly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-\\nopment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because\\nthe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormally\\nnarrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord or\\nnerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-\\nnum may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between the\\nbrain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulation\\nof too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Children\\nwith achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious and\\nrepeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear-\\ning loss.

X-\\nray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance to\\nthe bones, with the bones of the limbs appearing short in\\nlength, yet broad in width. A number of measurements of\\nthe bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions.\\nTreatment\\nNo treatment will reverse the defect present in achon-\\ndroplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, with\\nabnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head.

Like all\\nenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-\\ntions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose\\nwhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the\\nbody (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness of\\ntreatment. The test has been largely supplanted by the\\nprostate specific antigen test (PSA).\\nPurpose\\nThe male prostate gland has 100 times more acid\\nphosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostate\\ncancer spreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-\\nphatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads to\\nthe bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who have\\nmetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphatase\\nlevels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reduced\\nthrough treatment.\\nTissues other than prostate have small amounts of\\nacid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,\\nand red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissues\\ncauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.\\nAcid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.\\nRape investigations will often include testing for the\\npresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid\\nphosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer has\\nmetastasized.\\nDescription\\nLaboratory testing measures the amount of acid\\nphosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine from\\nwhat tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it is\\nimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase is\\nfrom the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase\\nfrom the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase\\n(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acid\\nphosphatase.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEnzyme—A substance needed to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions.\\nMetastasize —Spread to other parts of the body;\\nusually refers to cancer.\\nProstate gland—A gland of the male reproductive\\nsystem.\\nSubtle differences between prostatic acid phos-\\nphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues cause\\nthem to react differently in the laboratory when mixed\\nwith certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-\\ncal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-\\nstatic acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-\\nphatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-\\nences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-\\nphatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usually\\navailable the next day.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.\\nThe patient should not have a rectal exam or prostate\\nmassage for two to three days prior to the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applying\\npressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops will\\nreduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will\\nrelieve discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in\\nmetastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the bone, such\\nas Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism; diseases of\\nblood cells, such as sickle cell disease or multiple\\nmyeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher’s dis-\\nease, will show moderately increased levels.\\nCertain medications can cause temporary increases\\nor decreases in acid phosphatase levels.

It occurs when the\\npores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin\\ncells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is\\nthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 million\\npeople in the United States. While acne can arise at any\\nage, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado-\\nlescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some time\\nbetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of women\\ndevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-\\nface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural\\nmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within\\nwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.\\nThese follicles open onto the skin through pores. At\\npuberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)\\ncause the glands to produce too much sebum. When\\nexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, a\\nhard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mild\\nnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-\\ndones, whiteheads and blackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-\\nbacterium acnes , a bacteria that normally lives on the\\nskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens\\nand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin and\\nwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed\\npimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when\\ndeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type of\\nacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hard\\nswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laid\\ndown to replace damaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the body\\nwhere the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the disease.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-\\ntion, during pregnancy, and menopause.\\n• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause\\nflare-ups.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including\\ntranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics, oral contra-\\nceptives, and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or\\npicking at pimples will make them worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,\\nand sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.\\n• Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\nAcne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed\\nlesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling.\\nThe most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-\\ntive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Some\\npeople, especially teenagers, become emotionally upset\\nabout their condition, and have problems forming rela-\\ntionships or keeping jobs.\\nDiagnosis\\nAcne patients are often treated by family doctors.\\nComplicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 224\\nAcne\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 24'),\n",

Under\\ngood lighting, the doctor determines what types and how\\nmany blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,\\nwhether they are deep or superficial, and whether there is\\nscarring or skin discoloration.\\nIn teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,\\nnose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appear\\ntowards the outer part of the face. Adult women may\\nhave acne on their chins and around their mouths. The\\nelderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on the\\nupper cheeks and skin around the eyes.\\nLaboratory tests are not done unless the patient\\nappears to have a hormonal disorder or other medical\\nproblem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests may\\nbe ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-\\nnosing and treating acne.\\nTreatment\\nAcne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-\\ntion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria with\\ntopical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choice\\ndepends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, or\\nsevere.\\nDrugs\\nTOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma-\\ntory acne consists of reducing the formation of new\\ncomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-\\npalene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effective\\nbecause it increases turnover (death and replacement) of\\nskin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topical\\nantibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.\\nImprovement is usually seen in two to four weeks.\\nTopical medications are available as cream, gel,\\nlotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. They\\ninclude antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-\\nthromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline\\n(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugs\\nand open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin\\n(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-\\nnol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics and\\nantibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid\\n(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-\\nmycin), are also used. These drugs may be used for\\nmonths to years to achieve disease control.\\nAfter washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied\\nalone or in combination, once or twice a day over the\\nentire affected area of skin. Possible side effects include\\nmild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased\\nsensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.\\nORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for\\ntwo to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,\\nerythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-\\ndamycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole\\n(Bactrim, Septra).

The vestibular and cochlear\\nnerves lie next to one another. They also run along side\\nother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type of\\nvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the left\\near and one that extends from the right ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concern-\\ning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlear\\nnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibular\\nnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called a\\nmyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-\\ntimes develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumor\\nis an abnormal growth of tissue that results from the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are often\\ncalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumors\\nthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds the\\nvestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered\\nbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread to\\nother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere along\\nthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where the\\nvestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canal\\nthat connects the brain and the inner ear.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-\\nlar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumor\\nis a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumor\\narises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acoustic\\nneuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilat-\\neral acoustic neuromas occur as part of a hereditary con-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 27\\nAcoustic neuroma\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 27'),\n",

A person\\nwith NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing\\nacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.\\nAcoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can\\ntake years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remain\\nso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the\\nacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-\\ntioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo and\\nbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows large\\nenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing\\nloss and a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu-\\nally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-\\nues to grow it can press against other nerves in the region\\nand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-\\nening if it becomes large enough to press against and\\ninterfere with the functioning of the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in a\\nnerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes in\\nevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. One\\nNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother and\\none NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of the\\nfather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-\\nvent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-\\nular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.\\nOnly one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is\\nnecessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-\\nma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing in\\none of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nerve\\nthen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-\\nlateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genes\\nbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someone\\nwith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developed\\nspontaneously is not at increased risk for having children\\nwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-\\nromas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also\\npossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be\\ncaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-\\nventing the formation of tumors.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is\\naffected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person with\\nNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and one\\nchanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.\\nSometimes they inherit this change from their mother or\\nfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously when\\nthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell of\\nthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%\\nchance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.\\nA person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-\\nma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-\\ntaneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath\\ncells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 often\\ndevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The mean\\nage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years of\\nage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-\\nmas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acoustic\\nneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk for\\ndeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.\\nMost people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are\\nnot affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,\\nonly develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear\\nnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-\\nal tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve a\\nnumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-\\none under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-\\nroma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and\\nother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably is\\naffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts\\nand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the\\nother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral\\nacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family history\\nof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with\\nthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The most\\ncommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing\\nloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-\\nnitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report\\ndifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceiving\\nthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when their\\nhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases the\\nhearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually over\\ntime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-\\nmately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of\\nthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve and\\nvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent of\\nsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, which\\nis characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation.\\nLarger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigo\\nbut more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,\\nwhich is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-\\nal feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of people\\nwith an acoustic neuroma.\\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-\\ning cranial nerves.

Com-\\nputerized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is unable to\\nidentify smaller tumors; but it can be used when an\\nacoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI evaluation\\ncannot be performed.\\nOnce an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evalua-\\ntion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genet-\\nic counselor may be recommended. The purpose of this\\nevaluation is to obtain a detailed family history and\\ncheck for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected\\nthen DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testing\\ninvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-\\ntine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-\\ned with NF2.\\nTreatment\\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician\\nand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-\\nent options prior to making a decision about treatment.\\nThe patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumor\\nsize, and tumor location should be considered.\\nMicrosurgery\\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In most\\ncases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. If\\nthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yet\\nthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then only\\npart of the tumor may be removed. During the procedure\\nthe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance and\\ngeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranial\\nnerves is done during the procedure so that damage to\\nthese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearing\\nis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take\\nplace during the surgery.\\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes four\\nto six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head\\ndiscomfort following the surgery. Problems with balance\\nand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-\\ntality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at most\\nmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-\\nence some degree of post-surgical complications. In most\\ncases these complications can be managed successfully\\nand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgery\\nbrings with it a risk of stroke, damage to the brain stem,\\ninfection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-\\nnial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from\\nthe surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to\\nfive years following the surgery because of possible\\nregrowth of the tumor.\\nStereotactic Radiation therapy\\nDuring stereotactic radiation therapy , also called\\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-\\ntion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-\\nation is administered in a single large dose, under local\\nanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This\\nresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but little\\nradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-\\nment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.\\nThe goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or at\\nleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-\\ncy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.\\nPeriodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of the\\npatient is therefore recommended.\\nRadiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can\\nsometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can\\nalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, which\\ncan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis\\nof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms are\\ntemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-\\ntion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This type\\nof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-\\nment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-\\ndisposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.\\nObservation\\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in\\nsome cases they will stop growing and even become\\nsmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-\\npriate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-\\nodically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.\\nLong-term observation may be appropriate for example\\nin an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma and\\nfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-\\ned for someone with a small and asymptomatic acoustic\\nneuroma that was detected through an evaluation for\\nanother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-\\ngested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the only\\nhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-\\nger of an observational approach is that as the tumor\\ngrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-\\nnosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Long\\nterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-\\nmon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth of\\nthe tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiation\\ntherapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno-\\nsis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increased\\nrisk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 230\\nAcoustic neuroma\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 30'),\n",

The hands and feet turn blue\\nbecause of the lack of oxygen. Decreased blood supply\\nto the affected areas is caused by constriction or spasm of\\nsmall blood vessels.\\nDescription\\nAcrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constric-\\ntion or narrowing of small blood vessels in the skin of affect-\\ned patients. The spasm of the blood vessels decreases the\\namount of blood that passes through them, resulting in less\\nblood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands may\\nbe the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue and\\nbecome cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.\\nEmotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms,\\nwhile warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seen\\nmainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainly\\ncosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable,\\nwith sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasms\\nin the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to the\\nextremities. The spasms are a contraction of the muscles\\nin the walls of the blood vessels. The contraction\\ndecreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels,\\nthereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through the\\naffected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis,\\nresulting in long term reduction of blood supply to the\\nhands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through the\\nblood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas does\\nnot starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels near\\nthe surface of the skin are affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by observation of the main clini-\\ncal symptoms, including persistently blue and sweaty\\nhands and/or feet and a lack of pain.

This chemical released from the pituitary gland\\nis called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability to\\nKEY TERMS\\nSympathetic nerve —A nerve of the autonomic\\nnervous system that regulates involuntary and\\nautomatic reactions, especially to stress.\\nprocess and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also\\naltered. In children whose bony growth plates have not\\nclosed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result in\\nexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is called\\ngigantism, with the additional bone growth causing\\nunusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bone\\ngrowth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.\\nDescription\\nAcromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in\\napproximately 50 out of every one million people (50/\\n1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Because\\nthe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-\\nsis is often delayed. The majority of patients are not\\nidentified until they are middle aged.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases\\ncertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important to\\nthe functioning of other organs or body systems. The\\npituitary hormones travel throughout the body and are\\ninvolved in a large number of activities, including the\\nregulation of growth and reproductive functions. The\\ncause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-\\nduction of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\\nfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, located\\nat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-\\nmus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For\\nexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-\\nreleasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitary\\nto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should also\\ndirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH\\nand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,\\nGH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like\\ngrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growth\\nthroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stop\\nproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormal\\npeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the body\\nbegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability to\\nprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin\\nto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,\\nand forehead also grow, and facial features are described\\nas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and because\\nthe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.\\nDue to swelling within the structures of the throat and\\nsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-\\nlow, and patients may develop loud snoring. Various hor-\\nmonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 232\\nAcromegaly and gigantism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32'),\n",

This increase in skin tags\\nis also associated with the development of growths,\\ncalled polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-\\nally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often\\nsuffer from headaches and arthritis. The various\\nswellings and enlargements throughout the body may\\npress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling or\\nburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of\\npatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-\\nin the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors\\nare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As these\\ntumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within the\\nbrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-\\nnoma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering\\nwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions may\\nbe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of\\nwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,\\nand the abnormal production of breast milk in women. In\\nrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-\\ntion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production of\\nGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,\\nthyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggers\\nproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, the\\ncharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is often\\nnot recognized by family members, friends, or long-time\\nfamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by a\\nnew physician who sees the patient for the first time and\\nis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.\\nComparing old photographs from a number of different\\ntime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies widely\\nunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels of\\nGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of\\nacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an\\nincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are\\nuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-\\npreted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 vary\\nwhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder-\\nly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show a\\ndecrease in GH production when given a large dose of\\nsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not show\\nthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-\\nduction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful\\nfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locating\\nan adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the search\\nfor a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of\\nall or part of the pituitary adenoma.

Actinomyces israelii is an anaerobic\\nbacterium which means it dislikes oxygen but grows very\\nwell in deep tissues where oxygen levels are low.

The lump\\nmay or may not be red. Fever occurs in some cases.\\nDiagnosis\\nCervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by a fam-\\nily doctor or dentist and the patient may be referred to an oral\\nsurgeon or infectious disease specialist. The diagnosis of\\nactinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of a\\nred lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly\\nsuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history of\\ntooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or poor dental\\nhygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of the\\nfluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “sul-\\nfur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro-\\nduced by Actinomyces israelii. A biopsy may be performed to\\nremove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure can be\\nperformed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office.

Chi-\\nnese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure,\\nherbal remedies, diet, exercise , lifestyle changes, and\\nother remedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly all\\nof the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in the\\nWest today, including acupuncture, acupressure, shiatsu,\\nand Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese\\nmedicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-\\npressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the\\npuncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain\\npoints on the body created interesting results when stim-\\nulated. The oldest known text specifically on acupunc-\\nture points, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates\\nback to 282 \\nA.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form of\\nacupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined that\\nstimulating points on the body with massage and pres-\\nsure could be effective for treating certain problems.\\nOutside of Asian-American communities, Chinese\\nmedicine remained virtually unknown in the United\\nStates until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became the\\nfirst U.S. president to visit China.

Despite\\nbeing neglected by mainstream medicine and the Ameri-\\ncan Medical Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chi-\\nnese medicine became a central to alternative medicine\\npractitioners in the United States. Today, there are mil-\\nlions of patients who attest to its effectiveness, and near-\\nly 9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.\\nAcupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese\\nmedicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as by\\nmassage therapists. Most massage schools in American\\ninclude acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork\\nprograms.

Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\\npurely physical mechanisms, and considers factors like\\nwork, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a\\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\\nreactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi,\\nand the organ system to describe health and the body.\\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\\nyang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-\\nward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,\\nmale, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.\\nNothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-\\nciples always interact and affect each other, although the\\nbody and its organs can become imbalanced by having\\neither too much or too little of either.\\nChi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi or ki in Japan-\\nese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy.

Chinese medicine has developed intri-\\ncate systems of how organs are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and it has devised corresponding\\ntreatments using the meridian and pressure point net-\\nworks that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu-\\npressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblock\\nthe circulation of chi, by activating very specific points,\\ncalled pressure points or acupoints . Acupressure seeks\\nto stimulate the points on the chi meridians that pass\\nclose to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock and\\nmanipulate with finger pressure.\\nAcupressure can be used as part of a Chinese\\nphysician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther-\\napy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill-\\nnesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a\\npatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental and\\nemotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the\\nwrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and\\nobserving the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get a\\ncomplete diagnosis of which organs and meridian\\npoints are out of balance.

Acupressure should not be\\napplied to open wounds, or where there is swelling and\\ninflammation. Areas of scar tissue, blisters,boils, rashes,\\nor varicose veins should be avoided. Finally, certain acu-\\npressure points should not be stimulated on people with\\nhigh or low blood pressure and on pregnant women.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nIn general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gain\\nacceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideas\\nvery foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West-\\nern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-\\nble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-\\ntain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-\\ntimes too simple for scientists to believe.\\nWestern scientists, in trying to account for the action\\nof acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of\\nthe neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-\\npedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominated\\nfor the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject called\\nCross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-\\nils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measur-\\ning devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the\\nbody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, and\\nthat traditional acupressure meridians and points contained\\namounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.\\nThe mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure\\nremain difficult to document in terms of the biochemical\\nprocesses involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-\\nry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressure\\nand acupuncture. However, a body of research is growing\\nthat verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and\\nacupuncture techniques in treating many problems and in\\ncontrolling pain.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nJarmey, Chris and John Tindall.

Acupuncture is limited in\\ntreating conditions or traumas that require surgery or\\nemergency care (such as for broken bones).\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nThe original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei\\nChing, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-\\ncine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old.\\nThousands of books since then have been written on the\\nsubject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies\\nspread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all of\\nthe forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the West\\ntoday, including acupuncture, shiatsu, acupressure mas-\\nsage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots in\\nChinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture devel-\\noped when early Chinese physicians observed unpredict-\\ned effects of puncture wounds in Chinese warriors. The\\noldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic\\nof Acupuncture, dates back to 282 \\nA.D. Although acupunc-\\nture is its best known technique, Chinese medicine tradi-\\ntionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestyle\\nchanges and other means to treat patients.\\nIn the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians\\nwho had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,\\nbut outside of Asian-American communities it remained\\nvirtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon\\nbecame the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s\\ntrip, journalists were amazed to observe major operations\\nbeing performed on patients without the use of anesthetics.\\nInstead, wide-awake patients were being operated on with\\nonly acupuncture needles inserted into them to control\\npain. During that time, a famous columnist for the New\\nYork Times, James Reston, had to undergo surgery and\\nelected to use acupuncture instead of pain medication, and\\nhe wrote some convincing stories on its effectiveness.\\nToday acupuncture is being practiced in all 50 states\\nby over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000 MDs includ-\\ning it in their practices. Acupuncture has shown notable\\nsuccess in treating many conditions, and over 15 million\\nAmericans have used it as a therapy.

The American Medical Association has been\\nresistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts very\\ndifferent from the Western scientific model.\\nSeveral forms of acupuncture are being used today in\\nAmerica. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-\\ndles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-\\ntice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points only\\non the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balance\\ninternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-\\nular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-\\nrologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncture\\nbased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditional\\nChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.\\nBasic ideas of Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\\nthe universe, and subject to universal laws and principles\\nof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not\\ndraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, between\\nmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-\\ntions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-\\nease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-\\ntors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as\\nfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.\\nChinese medicine also uses very different symbols and\\nideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-\\nicine typically describes health in terms of measurable\\nphysical processes made up of chemical reactions, the\\nChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-\\ntem, and the five elements to describe health and the\\nbody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever\\ncompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.\\nThese two principles are always interacting, opposing,\\nand influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-\\ncine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow\\nthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniously\\ntogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 41\\nAcupuncture\\nConception vessel\\nStomach meridian\\nLarge intestine meridian\\nGallbladder meridian\\nGovernor vessel\\nBladder meridian\\nTriple burner meridian\\nSmall intestine meridian\\nAcupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck.(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 41'),\n",

Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or\\nincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food\\nand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force\\nthat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-\\nited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from\\nthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and\\nquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of\\nphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels\\nthrough the body along channels called meridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. As\\nthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi\\nwhich can move through the body, and these move\\nthrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese\\ndoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptoms\\nare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or more\\norgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from one\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure —Form of massage using acupunc-\\nture points.\\nAuricular acupuncture —Acupuncture using only\\npoints found on the ears.\\nChi—Basic life energy.\\nMeridian —Channel through which chi travels in\\nthe body.\\nMoxibustion —Acupuncture technique which\\nburns the herb moxa or mugwort.\\nTonification—Acupuncture technique for strength-\\nening the body.\\nYin/Yang—Universal characteristics used to des-\\ncribe aspects of the natural world.\\norgan to another. Each organ has a different profile of\\nsymptoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-\\nry is that the world and body are made up of five main\\nelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-\\nments are all interconnected, and each element either\\ngenerates or controls another element. For instance,\\nwater controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ\\nis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese\\nsystem uses elements and organs to describe and treat\\nconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with\\nwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the two\\norgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-\\nney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire\\nproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made by\\nacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or\\nincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-\\nple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Western\\nscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.\\nFor instance, Western medicine has observed that with\\nsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it\\nstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,\\nthis connection between the two organs has long been\\nestablished.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organ\\nsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy or\\ntreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate\\nharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors like\\nemotions, external factors like the environment and\\nweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, and\\ngerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily a\\nproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in the\\nenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.\\nIn Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,\\nas each body has its own characteristics of symptoms and\\nbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow\\nof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-\\nen the body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s\\nmedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-\\ntional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-\\nview. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient to\\nfind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the\\npulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-\\neral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. From\\nthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns of\\nsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 242\\nAcupuncture\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42'),\n",

Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-\\nist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or more\\nof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-\\nans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used in\\nacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-\\nquently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an\\nindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,\\ndepending on which meridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-\\ntion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels are\\nbeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficial\\nlayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a\\ndepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-\\nly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinching\\nsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-\\nriences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-\\nturist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight\\nelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may\\nbe sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa or\\nmugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncture\\npoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-\\nulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-\\ntimes use cupping, during which small suction cups are\\nplaced on meridian points to stimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies. Some\\npatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear\\nproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of\\nhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-\\ndles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit to\\nan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The number\\nof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with some\\nconditions improved in one or two sessions and others\\nrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course of\\nweeks or months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether\\nthe practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MD\\nacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-\\nits usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement also\\nvaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-\\nlations have been changing often. Some states authorize\\nMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, and\\nsome states have mandated that general coverage pay for\\nacupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisions\\nfor acupuncture in their individual policies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a\\npatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more than\\none physician should be consulted. Also, a patient should\\nalways feel comfortable and confident that their\\nacupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-\\nture; although more MDs are using it, the American Medical\\nAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty. The reason\\nfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult to\\nscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisible\\nenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting that\\nacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that the\\nenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system and\\nthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, or\\nnatural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-\\nguity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to\\nshow effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain to\\nalleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research\\nin acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-\\ntive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currently\\nfunding research in the use of acupuncture for treating\\ndepression and attention-deficit disorder.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFleischman, Dr. Gary F.

Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-\\ntioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin to\\naccumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in the\\nbloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure may\\nbecome puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,\\nand feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, and\\nthey may experience fatigue and nausea.\\nUnlike chronic kidney failure , which is long term\\nand irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-\\ndition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typically\\nbe reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to the\\nkidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently as\\na complication of serious illness, like heart failure,l i v e r\\nfailure, dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleed-\\ning (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-\\ntion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-\\nease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-\\nent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions\\nfall into three main categories: prerenal, postrenal, and\\nintrarenal conditions.\\nPrerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but\\ncan cause diminished kidney function. They are the most\\ncommon cause of acute renal failure, and include:\\n• dehydration\\n• hemorrhage\\n• septicemia, or sepsis\\n• heart failure\\n• liver failure\\n• burns\\nPostrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-\\ning the urinary tract. These conditions include:\\n• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)\\n• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic\\nhypertrophy)\\n• bladder or pelvic tumors\\n• kidney stones (calculi)\\nIntrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or\\ndirect injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:\\n• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)\\n• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney\\nproblems\\n• drug abuse or overdose\\n• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain\\npain medicines\\n• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the\\nkidney (glomerulonephritis)\\n• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)\\nCommon symptoms of acute kidney failure include:\\n• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-\\nthropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red blood\\ncell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking of\\nthe kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-\\ning to anemia.\\n• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may\\ncause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.\\n• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\\nD, which helps the body absorb calcium and keeps\\nbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones\\nmay become brittle. In children, normal growth may be\\nstunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of high\\nphosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acid\\nmay cause gout.\\n• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,\\nand around the eyes.\\n• frequent urination.\\n• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it\\nto foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate\\nbleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,\\nor ureters.\\n• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\\n• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. This\\nmakes blood pressure rise.\\n• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\\npresence of anemia may cause the patient to feel\\nexhausted.\\n• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,\\naccumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.\\nAn increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.\\n• lower back pain.

A nephrolo-\\ngist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-\\nsulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-\\nment options. The patient that is suspected of having\\nacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests to\\ndetermine the level of kidney function. A blood test will\\nassess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen\\n(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.\\nThe kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine\\nsamples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour\\nperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.\\nDetermining the cause of kidney failure is critical to\\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-\\nsary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and if\\nthe kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays,magnetic res-\\nonance imaging(MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),\\nultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys\\nmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure and\\nlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound\\nof the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment\\nis directed to the underlying, primary medical condition\\nthat has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions may\\nbe treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,\\ndiuretics, blood transfusion , or medications. Postrenal\\nconditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgery\\nand/or medication.\\nFrequently, patients in acute kidney failure require\\nhemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis to fil-\\nter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-\\nmary medical condition can be controlled.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s\\nblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-\\ncuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up of\\nplastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-\\nficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors and\\nmaintains blood flow and administers dialysate.\\nDialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to\\ndraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s blood\\nleaves the body through the vein and travels through the\\nECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.\\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream\\nare carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytes\\nand other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,\\nchemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product that\\nis formed in the liver and collects in the blood-\\nstream; patients with kidney failure have high\\nBUN levels.\\nCreatinine —A protein produced by muscle that\\nhealthy kidneys filter out.\\nExtracorporeal —Outside of, or unrelated to, the\\nbody.\\nIschemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ or\\ntissue.\\nNephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.\\nRadiocontrast agents —Dyes administered to a\\npatient for the purposes of a radiologic study.\\nSepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.\\nVasopressors—Medications that constrict the blood\\nvessels.\\nA dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,\\ndepending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical\\ncondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a\\nweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.\\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-\\nsis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-\\ntoneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option in\\nthese cases.\\nHemofiltration\\nHemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-\\nment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-\\ntion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-\\ncally ill patients. These patients are typically very sick\\nand may have heart problems or circulatory problems.\\nThey cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-\\nysis. They also frequently need antibiotics , nutrition ,\\nvasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein to\\ntreat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration is\\ncontinuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients in\\nkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.\\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A\\nhollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer to\\nremove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, a\\nblood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. The\\nvolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-\\ntration is less than that in hemodialysis.

It is also not recommended for patients\\nwho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of the\\nsmall pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).\\nPrognosis\\nBecause many of the illnesses and underlying con-\\nditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,\\nthe prognosis for these patients many times is not good.\\nStudies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid-\\nney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, die\\nbecause of the primary disease that has caused the kid-\\nney failure. These figures may also be misleading\\nbecause patients who experience kidney failure as a\\nresult of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones or\\ndehydration) have an excellent chance of complete\\nrecovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriate\\ntreatment are key to patient recovery.\\nUp to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney\\nfailure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They will\\neventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure or\\nend-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-\\nterm dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their\\nlost renal functioning.\\nPrevention\\nSince acute kidney failure can be caused by many\\nthings, prevention is difficult. Medications that may\\nimpair kidney function should be given cautiously.\\nPatients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are\\nhospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care-\\nfully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat-\\nments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid-\\nney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrast\\nagents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBock, G.

Once the bacteria enter the lymphatic\\nsystem, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphatic\\nvessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vessel\\nbecomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visible\\nbelow the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occurs\\nso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fast\\nenough to stop the infection.\\nIf left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue\\ndestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,\\npainful lump called an abscess may be formed in the\\ninfected area. Cellulitis , a generalized infection of the\\nlower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-\\nria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.\\nLay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seen\\nin the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-\\nous illness and may be fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-\\nterium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially danger-\\nous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of the\\nheart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has been\\ncalled the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-\\nria may also cause lymphangitis.\\nAlthough anyone can develop lymphangitis, some\\npeople are more at risk. People who have had radical mas-\\ntectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a\\nleg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrent\\nlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection on\\nthe foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis\\nare the wide, red streaks which travel from the site of\\ninfection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,\\nswollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin may\\noccur. The bacterial infection causes a fever of 100-104°F\\n(38°–40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscle\\naches, headache, chills, and loss of appetite may be felt.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf lymphangitis is suspected, the person should call\\nhis or her doctor immediately or go to an emergency\\nroom. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by the\\nfamily doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer-\\ngency room doctor. The painful, red streaks just below\\nthe skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acute\\nlymphangitis.

Diagnosis is\\nimmediate because it is based primarily on the symp-\\ntoms. Most insurance policies should cover the expenses\\nfor the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphangitis.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the serious nature of this infection, treat-\\nment would begin immediately even before the bacterial\\nculture results were available. The only treatment for\\nacute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an\\nantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growing\\nstreptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly and\\neasily by penicillin.

Antigens from the dead streptococci\\nclump together with the antibodies that killed them.\\nThese clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause the\\ntubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil-\\nity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset of\\nAPSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average two\\nweeks) after the streptococcal infection.\\nAPSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting\\nabout one of every 10,000 people, although four or five\\ntimes that many may actually be affected by it but show\\nno symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boys\\nbetween the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFrequent sore throats and a history of streptococcal\\ninfection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN. Symp-\\ntoms of APSGN include:\\n• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling (edema) initial-\\nly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs\\n• low urine output (oliguria)\\n• blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• high blood pressure\\n• joint pain or stiffness\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s\\nhistory, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-\\ntain laboratory tests. Urinalysis usually shows blood and\\nprotein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-\\nnine (two waste products normally filtered out of the\\nblood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-\\ncating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensive\\nblood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirm\\nthat a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. A\\nthroat culture may also show the presence of group A\\nbeta-hemolytic streptococci.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the\\nsymptoms and prevent complications. Some patients are\\nadvised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrict\\nfluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be prescribed to\\nkill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presence\\nis confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to help\\ncontrol high blood pressure and diuretics may be used to\\nreduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysis is\\nrarely needed.\\nPrognosis\\nMost children (up to 95%) fully recover from\\nAPSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults (up\\nto 70%) also recover fully.

(Dissociation is a psychological reaction to trauma\\nin which the mind tries to cope by “sealing off” some\\nfeatures of the trauma from conscious awareness).\\nDescription\\nAcute stress disorder is a new diagnostic category\\nthat was introduced in 1994 to differentiate time-limited\\nreactions to trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau-\\nma, which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fear\\nand, usually, involves threats to life or serious injury to\\noneself or others. Examples are rape, mugging, combat,\\nnatural disasters, etc.\\nThe symptoms of stress disorder include a combining\\nof one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms with\\nthe avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event. Disso-\\nciative symptoms include emotional detachment, tempo-\\nrary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.\\nAnxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-\\nder include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-\\nlems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com-\\nbination of the patient’s history and a physical examina-\\ntion to rule out diseases that can cause anxiety.

The term has\\nbeen partially replaced by the word dependence for sub-\\nstance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, to\\ninclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Some\\nresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substance\\naddictions (for example, alcoholism , drug abuse, and\\nsmoking ); and process addictions (for example, gam-\\nbling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).\\nThere is a growing recognition that many addicts, such as\\npolydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-\\nstance or process.\\nDescription\\nAddiction is one of the most costly public health\\nproblems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-\\ndrome, which means that it increases in severity over\\ntime unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterized\\nby frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.\\nSubstance abusers often make repeated attempts to quit\\nbefore they are successful.\\nIn 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in the\\nUnited States exceeded $414 billion, with health care\\ncosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at more\\nthan $114 billion.\\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed\\nalcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% have\\nsmoked marijuana. Compared to females, males are\\nalmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearly\\none and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more of\\ncigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuana\\nweekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-\\nferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-\\nco, cocaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained\\nstable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.\\nIn 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the\\nage of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and\\nstimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.\\nIn the United States, 25% of the population regularly\\nuses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times as\\nmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-\\nbined. According to 1998 data from the World Health\\nOrganization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwide\\nand 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,\\nin the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years are\\nexposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which has\\nbeen implicated in sudden infant death syndrome,l o w\\nbirth weight, asthma, middle ear disease, pneumonia ,\\ncough, and upper respiratory infection.\\nEating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulim-\\nia nervosa , and binge eating, affect over five million\\nAmerican women and men. Fifteen percent of young\\nwomen have substantially disordered attitudes toward\\neating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women die\\neach year from anorexia nervosa.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 250\\nAddiction\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50'),\n",

Some forms of substance abuse and\\ndependence seem to run in families; and this may be the\\nresult of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-\\nences, or a combination of both.\\nBrain structure and function\\nUsing drugs repeatedly over time changes brain\\nstructure and function in fundamental and long-lasting\\nways. Addiction comes about through an array of\\nchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-\\nry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lasting\\nbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-\\nnitive and emotional functioning that characterize\\naddicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.\\nAlthough the causes of addiction remain the subject of\\nongoing debate and research, many experts now consider\\naddiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused by\\npersistent changes in brain structure and function. How-\\never, having this brain disease does not absolve the\\naddict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it does\\nexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs by\\nsheer force of will alone.\\nSocial learning\\nSocial learning is considered the most important sin-\\ngle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-\\nly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or media\\ninfluence.\\nAvailability\\nInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, or\\ndrugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.\\nIndividual development\\nBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality\\nwas used to explain the development of addiction. The\\naddictive personality was described as escapist, impul-\\nsive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-\\ntered. Many doctors now believe that these character\\ntraits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,\\nrather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn addition to a preoccupation with using and\\nacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-\\ntion is based on five criteria:\\n• loss of willpower\\n• harmful consequences\\n• unmanageable lifestyle\\n• tolerance or escalation of use\\n• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 51\\nAddiction\\nCrack users.

Substance addicts may need hospital treat-\\nment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual or\\ngroup psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after sub-\\nstance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications, such\\nas methadone and naltrexone, are also commonly used.\\nThe most frequently recommended social form of\\noutpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Such\\nprograms are also frequently combined with psychother-\\napy. According to a recent study reported by the Ameri-\\ncan Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless\\nof his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,\\ncan benefit from participation in 12-step programs such\\nas Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anony-\\nmous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help\\ngroups exceeds the number of visits to all mental health\\nprofessionals combined. There are twelve-step groups\\nfor all major substance and process addictions.\\nThe Twelve Steps are:\\n• Admit powerlessness over the addiction.\\n• Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restore\\nsanity.\\n• Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to\\nthe care of God, as you understand him.\\n• Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self.\\n• Admit to God, yourself, and another human being the\\nexact nature of your wrongs.\\n• Become willing to have God remove all these defects\\nfrom your character.\\n• Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.\\n• Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs and\\nbecome willing to make amends to them all.\\n• Make direct amends to such people, whenever possible\\nexcept when to do so would injure them or others.\\n• Continue to take personal inventory and promptly\\nadmit any future wrongdoings.\\n• Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’s\\nunderstanding through meditation and prayer.\\n• Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others and\\npractice these principles in all your affairs.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture and homeopathy have been used to\\ntreat withdrawal symptoms.

This results in decreased production of two\\nimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released by\\nthe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the gland\\nis known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the\\nmedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is\\nresponsible for producing different types of hormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning\\nof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout the\\nbody, and is considered to be one of the few hormones\\nabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:\\n• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-\\nents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heart\\nKEY TERMS\\nGland—A collection of cells whose function is to\\nrelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which are\\nimportant to the functioning of other, sometimes\\ndistantly located, organs or body systems.\\nHormone —A chemical produced in one part of\\nthe body, which travels to another part of the body\\nin order to exert its effect.\\n• the functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells\\n• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-\\ntal system\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-\\nportions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-\\nance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughout\\nthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a\\ndrop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-\\ncal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferes\\ndirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce\\nits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosterone\\ndrop, and numerous functions throughout the body are\\ndisrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is the\\ndestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal\\ncortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, and\\ndestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of\\nthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis . The\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by\\nfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis , coccidiomy-\\ncosis, and cryptococcosis , which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53\\nAddison’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53'),\n",

The most com-\\nmon symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy,\\ndecreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,\\nabdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness, dizzi-\\nness when standing, dehydration , unusual areas of\\ndarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the\\ndisease progresses, the patient may appear to have very\\ntanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining of\\nthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentation\\nof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration\\nbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continue\\nto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak and\\nlight-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-\\ntoms, including depression and irritability. Women lose\\npubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-\\nstrual periods.\\nWhen a patient becomes ill with an infection, or\\nstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and\\nrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms\\nof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heart\\nrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-\\ntrollable nausea and vomiting , a drastic drop in blood\\npressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About\\n25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified due\\nto the development of Addisonian crisis.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany patients do not recognize the slow progres-\\nsion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified\\nwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-\\ntation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of blood\\ntests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It is\\nnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,\\nas normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,\\npatients are given a testing dose of another hormone\\ncalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in the\\nbody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-\\nmoting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulating\\nthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-\\nease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase\\ncortisol levels.\\nTo distinguish between primary adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary\\nadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the\\npituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in\\nthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels of\\nACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,\\nbut the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to the\\npresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis of\\nAddison’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing\\nthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-\\nonian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potent\\nform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in a\\nvein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss will\\nalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-\\ntions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressure\\nmay require special medications to safely elevate it until\\nthe steroids take effect.\\nPatients with Addison’s disease will need to take a\\nsteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement\\nfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest of\\ntheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causes\\nnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold down\\ntheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medical\\nfacility where IV medications can be administered.\\nWhen a patient has any kind of infection or injury, the\\nnormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients appropriately treated with\\nhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. These\\npatients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Without\\ntreatment, or with substandard treatment, patients are\\nalways at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nWilliams, Gordon H., and Robert G.

The tonsils\\nbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-\\nnoids lie just above them and are hidden from view by the\\npalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defense\\nguard the major entrance to the body from foreign\\ninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to the\\nrest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its\\ngreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. In\\nthis way children are best able to develop the immunities\\nthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue\\ngrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-\\ntion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fight\\noff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to its\\nformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind a\\nlarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make matters\\nworse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophied\\nglands can produce safe havens for germs where the\\nbody cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi-\\notics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases\\nover the past few generations, tonsils and adenoids\\ncaused greater health problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply\\ncaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-\\nsue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throat\\ninfections by cold viruses, strep throat, mononucleosis,\\nand in times gone by, diphtheria . The acute infections\\nare usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting\\nlittle recognition because they cannot be seen without\\nspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, bright\\nred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes\\n(glands) beneath the jaw,fever, and general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-\\nerated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely large\\ntonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although that\\nis quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathing\\nand require a child to breathe through the mouth. Because\\nthey encircle the only connection between the middle ear\\nand the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can also\\nobstruct it and cause middle ear infections.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEustacian tube—A tube connecting the middle ear\\nwith the back of the nose, allowing air pressure to\\nequalize within the ear whenever it opens, such as\\nwith yawning.\\nHyperplastic—Overgrown.\\nHypertrophy—Overgrowth.\\nStrep throat—An infection of the throat caused by\\nbacteria of the Streptococcus family, which causes\\ntonsillitis.\\nUlcerated—Damaged so that the surface tissue is\\nlost and/or necrotic (dead).\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows\\nan adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils may\\nhave deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue\\n(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-\\nror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle ear\\ninfections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-\\nture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-\\nty of the germ.\\nTreatment\\nIt used to be standard practice to remove tonsils\\nand/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or ear\\ninfection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-\\nnoidectomy(T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized\\nthat this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-\\nty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-\\nduce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine. In addi-\\ntion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibiotics\\nand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainage\\nthrough the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reduced\\nthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are many botanical/herbal remedies that can\\nbe used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsils\\nand adenoids in their immune function at the opening of\\nthe oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping the\\nEustachian tubes open is an important contribution to\\noptimal function in the tonsils and adenoids.

About 47 dif-\\nferent types have been identified since then, and about\\nhalf of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infants\\nand children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-\\nes. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,\\nbut seem to be most common from fall to spring.\\nAdenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-\\npiratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-\\nnesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to cause\\ninfection among military recruits and other young people\\nwho live in institutional environments. Outbreaks among\\nchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools and\\nsummer camps.\\nAcquired immunity\\nMost children have been infected by at least one\\nadenovirus by the time they reach school age. Most\\nadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus\\ntypes due to infections they had as children.\\nIn one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic\\ninfection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-\\nnoviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-\\nlion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-\\ntious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. In\\nchronic or latent infection, a much smaller number of\\nviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply more\\nrapidly than they are destroyed. People who have this\\nkind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probably\\nwhy many adults have immunity to adenoviruses without\\nrealizing they have been infected.\\nChildhood infections\\nIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acute\\nupper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.\\nAdenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible for\\nmost of these infections. Occasionally more serious\\nlower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia , may\\noccur.\\nAdenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival\\nfever in children. This disease is most often caused by\\ntypes 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly and\\nusually disappear in less than a week, include:\\n• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)\\n•f e v e r\\n• sore throat (pharyngitis)\\n• runny nose\\n• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical\\nadenitis)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 256\\nAdenovirus infections\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56'),\n",

A\\nchild who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine for\\nabout three days, and invisible traces of blood can be\\nfound in the urine a few days longer. The child will feel\\nthe urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to do\\nso—for about the same length of time.\\nAdult infections\\nIn adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus\\ninfection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused by\\ntypes 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-\\ntoms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough\\nare almost always present; weakness, chills, headache ,\\nand swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.\\nThe symptoms typically last three to five days.\\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-\\nnovirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyard\\nworkers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips of\\nrust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye-\\nlid and covering the front of the eyeball can also be\\ncaused by using contaminated contact lens solutions or\\nby drying the hands or face with a towel used by some-\\none who has this infection.\\nThe inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con-\\njunctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and last\\nbetween one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of patients with\\nepidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience respiratory\\nsymptoms. One or both eyes may be affected. As symp-\\ntoms of conjunctivitis subside, eye pain and watering\\nand blurred vision develop. These symptoms of keratitis\\nmay last for several months, and about 10% of these\\ninfections spread to at least one other member of the\\npatient’s household.\\nOther illnesses associated with adenovirus include:\\n• encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and other\\ninfections of the central nervous system (CNS)\\n• gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intes-\\ntines)\\n• acute mesenteric lymphadenitis (inflammation of\\nlymph glands in the abdomen)\\n• chronic interstitial fibrosis (abnormal growth of con-\\nnective tissue between cells)\\n• intussusception (a type of intestinal obstruction)\\nKEY TERMS\\nConjunctivitis —Inflammation of the conjunctiva,\\nthe mucous membrane lining the inner surfaces of\\nthe eyelid and the front of the eyeball.\\nVirus—A small infectious agent consisting of a\\ncore of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surround-\\ned by a shell of protein.\\n• pneumonia that doesn’t respond to antibiotic therapy\\n• whooping cough syndrome when Bordetella pertussis\\n(the bacterium that causes classic whooping cough) is\\nnot found\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSpecific adenovirus infections can be traced to par-\\nticular sources and produce distinctive symptoms. In\\ngeneral, however, adenovirus infection is caused by:\\n• inhaling airborne viruses\\n• getting the virus in the eyes by swimming in contami-\\nnated water, using contaminated eye solutions or instru-\\nments, wiping the eyes with contaminated towels, or\\nrubbing the eyes with contaminated fingers.\\n• not washing the hands after using the bathroom, and\\nthen touching the mouth or eyes\\nSymptoms common to most types of adenovirus\\ninfections include:\\n• cough\\n•f e v e r\\n• runny nose\\n• sore throat\\n• watery eyes\\nDiagnosis\\nAlthough symptoms may suggest the presence of\\nadenovirus, distinguishing these infections from other\\nviruses can be difficult. A definitive diagnosis is based on\\nculture or detection of the virus in eye secretions, spu-\\ntum, urine, or stool.\\nThe extent of infection can be estimated from the\\nresults of blood tests that measure increases in the quan-\\ntity of antibodies the immune system produces to fight it.\\nAntibody levels begin to rise about a week after infection\\noccurs and remain elevated for about a year.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 57\\nAdenovirus infections\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 57'),\n",

The\\nadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland\\nwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The\\nmain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the\\nmain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.\\nWhen tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secrete\\nexcess amounts of these hormones. A cancer that arises\\nin the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino-\\nma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain,\\nexcess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. A\\ncancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy-\\ntoma and can cause high blood pressure, headache, pal-\\npitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these can-\\ncers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,\\nbut some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 59\\nAdrenal gland cancer\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 59'),\n",

An adrenocortical car-\\ncinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol, pro-\\nducing Cushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome produces\\nprogressive weight gain, rounding of the face, and\\nincreased blood pressure. Women can experience men-\\nstrual cycle alterations and men can experience feminiza-\\ntion. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma include\\nhypertension , acidosis, unexplained fever and weight\\nloss. Because of the hormones produced by this type of\\ntumor, anxiety is often a feature also.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with\\nblood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor-\\nmones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone. It\\nalso includes magnetic resonance imaging , and com-\\nputed tomography scans to determine the extent of the\\ndisease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect the\\nhigh levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is aimed at removing the tumor by\\nsurgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy.\\nSurgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapy and/or\\nradiation therapy . Because the surgery removes the\\nsource of many important hormones, hormones must be\\nsupplemented following surgery.

The adrenal glands produce many hormones\\nthat regulate body functions. These hormones include\\nandrogens, or male hormones. Androgens are produced\\nin normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or both of\\nthe adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro-\\nducing more than the usual amount of androgens. The\\nexcess androgens create masculine characteristics.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually\\nthe result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present at\\nbirth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia .\\nThe cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to\\nsevere enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril-\\nism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor can\\nbe benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car-\\ncinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type of\\ntumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).\\nNewborn girls with adrenal virilism have external\\nsex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and female\\norgans (called female pseudohermaphrodism). Newborn\\nboys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs,\\nand these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace.\\nChildren with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begin\\ngrowing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlier\\nthan normal. Later in childhood, they are typically short-\\ner than normal but have well-developed trunks.\\nWomen with adrenal virilization may develop facial\\nhair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent or\\nabsent. They may also develop a deeper voice, a more\\nprominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.\\nDiagnosis\\nEndocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have the\\nmost expertise to deal with adrenal virilization. Some\\nKEY TERMS\\nGlucocorticoid —A hormone produced by the\\nadrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increase\\nin blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules by\\nthe liver.\\nHydrocortisone—A hormone in the group of glu-\\ncocorticoid hormones.\\nPrednisone—A drug that functions as a glucocorti-\\ncoid hormone.\\ndoctors who treat disorders of the internal organs\\n(internists) and doctors who specialize in treating the\\nreproductive system of women (gynecologists) may also\\nbe able to help patients with this disorder.\\nDiagnosis involves performing many laboratory\\ntests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea-\\nsure the concentration of different hormones. Different\\nabnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a different\\npattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can also\\nhelp determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If a\\ntumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-\\nize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend on\\nobtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), and\\nexamining it under a microscope in order to verify its\\ncharacteristics.\\nTreatment\\nAdrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is\\ntreated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usually\\nprednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-\\ntisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-\\ned from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls with\\npseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make their\\nexternal sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor is\\ncausing the disorder, the treatment will depend on the\\ntype and location of the tumor. Information about the\\ntumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used to\\ndecide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient.\\nIf the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require special\\ntreatment depending on how far the cancer has\\nadvanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery,\\nmedications used to kill cancer cells ( chemotherapy ),\\nand x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancer\\ncells ( radiation therapy ). Sometimes the doctor must\\nremove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. If\\nthe tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumor\\nmay be the best option.\\nPrognosis\\nOngoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls\\nadrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but there\\nis no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder,\\npatients have a better prognosis if they have an early stage\\nof cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

Lampert\\nAdrenalectomy\\nDefinition\\nAdrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or\\nboth of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are paired\\nendocrine glands, one located above each kidney, that\\nproduce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,\\nandrogens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-\\nlectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)\\nsurgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use\\nlaparoscopy . With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be\\naccomplished through four very small incisions.\\nPurpose\\nAdrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with\\ntumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors may\\nbe malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessive\\namounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-\\ndure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and may\\nalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other parts\\nof the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-\\nmended when hormones produced by the adrenal glands\\naggravate another condition such as breast cancer.\\nPrecautions\\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-\\nsels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding\\nduring surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close to\\none of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),\\nand to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs to\\nremove the gland(s) without damaging any of these\\nimportant and delicate organs.\\nDescription\\nOpen adrenalectomy\\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-\\ntions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’s\\nbody type.\\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,\\njust under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operate\\non only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will run\\nunder just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-\\ntimes a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen\\nprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenal\\nglands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to be\\nremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.\\nThis approach is the most direct route to the adrenal\\nglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of the\\nsurrounding structures as the anterior approach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obese\\npatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeon\\nmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn the\\npatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the chest\\ncavity, either with or without part of the incision into the\\nabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipates\\na very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine or\\nremove nearby structures as well.\\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy\\nThis technique does not require the surgeon to open\\nthe body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2\\nin diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, just\\nunder the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-\\ngeon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on a\\ntelevision monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.\\nThe other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturized\\nversions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to be\\noperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-\\nside the body.\\nPreparation\\nMost aspects of preparation are the same as in other\\nmajor operations. In addition, hormone imbalances are\\noften a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicians\\nwill try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-\\ntion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors\\nmay cause other problems such as hypertension or inad-\\nequate potassium in the blood, and these problems also\\nshould be resolved if possible before surgery is per-\\nformed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicines\\nfor days or weeks before surgery.\\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a\\nCT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-\\nent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeons\\nmay order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing of\\nthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help\\nlocate exactly where the tumor is.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 63\\nAdrenalectomy\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 63'),\n",

Flores\\nAdrenogenital syndrome see Adrenal virilism\\nAdrenoleukodystrophy\\nDefinition\\nAdrenoleukodystrophy is a rare genetic disease\\ncharacterized by a loss of myelin surrounding nerve cells\\nin the brain and progressive adrenal gland dysfunction.\\nDescription\\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a member of a\\ngroup of diseases, leukodystrophies, that cause damage\\nto the myelin sheath of nerve cells. Approximately one in\\n100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basic\\nforms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. The\\nchildhood form of the disease is the classical form and is\\nthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-\\nally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys\\nbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the X\\nchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages four\\nand ten and can include many different symptoms, not all\\nof which appear together. The most common symptoms\\nare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-\\ntoms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorly\\narticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-\\nlems with gait and coordination, fatigue, increased skin\\npigmentation, and progressive dementia.\\nThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, is\\nusually associated with a normal life span, and usually\\nappears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may include\\nprogressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of the lower\\nlimbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-\\ntion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of the\\ndisease occasionally experience the same symptoms, as\\nwell as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessive\\nmuscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary\\nproblems. The neonatal form affects both male and\\nfemale infants and may produce mental retardation ,\\nfacial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor\\nmuscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.\\nNeonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These build\\nup in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.\\nThe build-up of very long chain fatty acids interferes\\nwith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-\\nterol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in\\nthe white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cells\\nare unable to function properly.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a\\nbiochemical test, and a family history. The biochemical\\ntest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids\\nin samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi, plasma,\\nred blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-\\ncate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carried\\non the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating\\nthe symptoms and supporting the patient with physical\\ntherapy, psychological counseling, and special education\\nin some cases.

Lohr, PhD\\nAdrenomyeloneuropathy see Adrenoleuko-\\ndystrophy\\nAdult respiratory distress\\nsyndrome\\nDefinition\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also\\ncalled acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type of\\nlung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis-\\nease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in the\\nlungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-\\ndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one\\nof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a\\ntrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown\\nof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid\\nfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung\\ninto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,\\nor capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs\\nat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).\\nThis is the all-important site where oxygen passes from\\nair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts\\nof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages this\\npoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,\\nwill allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,\\neventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result\\nis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is\\none of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the\\nother being heart failure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over\\nfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-\\nal derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these\\nmaterials join together with large molecules in the blood\\n(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-\\nbranes are very prominent in premature infants who\\ndevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called\\nhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or\\nlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather become\\nscarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-\\nmal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of the\\nlung to become narrower, and in time they, too, may\\nbecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungs\\nas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes much\\nharder for the patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when\\nregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearly\\ndrowning.\\n• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-\\ngen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in\\nitself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.\\n• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vessels\\nthroughout the body, including the lungs.\\n• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-\\neling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-\\nsels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 67\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67'),\n",

Convulsions also may cause some cases.\\nUsually ARDS develops within one to two days of the\\noriginal illness or injury. The person begins to take rapid\\nbut shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’s\\nchest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez-\\ning sounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the\\nskin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues to\\nfill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great trouble\\nbreathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple test using a device applied to the ear will\\nshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, and\\nthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from an\\nartery. The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages,\\nbut, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does not\\nbelong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heart\\nof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDS\\nand not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-\\nguish between these two possibilities is to place a catheter\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlveoli—The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-\\ning tubes of the lung where oxygen normally is\\ntaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.\\nAspiration—The process in which solid food, liq-\\nuids, or secretions that normally are swallowed\\nare, instead, breathed into the lungs.\\nCapillaries —The smallest arteries which, in the\\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that they\\ncan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\\nFace mask—The simplest way of delivering a high\\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or other\\nlow-oxygen conditions.\\nSteroids —A class of drugs resembling normal\\nbody substances that often help control inflamma-\\ntion in the body tissues.\\nVentilator —A mechanical device that can take\\nover the work of breathing for a patient whose\\nlungs are injured or are starting to heal.\\ninto a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.\\nIn this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillaries\\ncan be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-\\nies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.\\nTreatment\\nThe three main goals in treating patients with ARDS\\nare:\\n• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.\\nExamples are: to treat septic infection with the proper\\nantibiotics, and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if\\nARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.\\n• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to\\nleak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-\\ntain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones have\\nbeen tried because they can combat inflammation, but\\nthe actual results have been disappointing.\\n• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the\\nlung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered by\\na face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on a\\nventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through a\\ntube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in the\\nwindpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatment\\nmust be closely supervised, and the pressure adjusted\\nso that too much oxygen is not delivered.\\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-\\nsive care unit, where experienced staff and all needed\\nequipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,\\nby vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration . Also, the\\npatient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again by\\nvein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\\nPrognosis\\nIf the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to\\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,\\nsuch as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterial\\npneumonia will develop at some point. Without prompt\\ntreatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can be\\nexpected to die. With modern treatment, however, about\\nhalf of all patients will survive. Those who do live usually\\nrecover completely, with little or no long-term breathing\\ndifficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on a\\nventilator, but it may improve in the months after the\\npatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular\\npatient will recover depends to a great extent on whether\\nthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in the\\nfirst place can be effectively treated.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-\\neases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.

In the Western countries,\\nthe length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit of\\nthe life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. During\\nthe latter half of life, an individual is more prone to have\\nproblems with the various functions of the body and to\\ndevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-\\ndiovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive\\nand urinary systems are particularly affected. The most\\ncommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,\\ncancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and develop-\\nment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normal\\ntransition time after that flurry of activity. Although there\\nare quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-\\nability is not necessarily a part of aging. Health and\\nlifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of the\\nindividual, and determines the response to these changes.\\nBody functions that are most often affected by age include:\\n• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the\\nhighest pitched tones.\\n• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase by\\nas much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of body\\nfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulates\\naround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats is\\nimpaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,\\nincluding cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.\\n• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-\\nfore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.\\nAlso, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.\\n• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,\\nthus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\n• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in\\nstomach acid production.\\n• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an\\naccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.\\n• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.\\n• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.\\n• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,\\nleading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughout\\nthe body.\\n• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that\\nnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-\\nes are not as sharp, and memory and learning are\\ndiminished.\\n• A decrease in bone strength and density.\\n• Hormone levels, which gradually decline. The thyroid\\nand sexual hormones are particularly affected.\\n• Declining visual abilities. Age-related changes may\\nlead to diseases such as macular degeneration.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 69\\nAging\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 69'),\n",

It may be that several factors work\\ntogether or that one particular factor is at work more than\\nothers in a given individual.\\n• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The\\naging of the cells of each individual is programmed into\\nthe genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-\\nvenations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at a\\nrate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-\\ntion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain the\\nfunctions necessary for life.\\n• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed of\\ndestruction at the level of the chromosomes.\\n• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes in\\nthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stability\\nof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-\\ntioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.\\n• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of\\naging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical\\nreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-\\nence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of the\\nbody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die or\\nlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases to\\nfunction as a whole.\\n• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune\\nsystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is more\\nprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finally\\ncause death. Also, as the system breaks down, the body\\nis more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which the\\nbody’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material and\\nare destroyed or damaged by the immune system.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany problems can arise due to age-related changes\\nin the body. Although there is no one test to be given, a\\nthorough physical exam and a basic blood screening and\\nblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-\\nther attention. When older people become ill, the first\\nsigns of disease are often nonspecific. Further exams\\nshould be conducted if any of the following occur:\\n• diminished or lack of desire for food\\n• increasing confusion\\n• failure to thrive\\n• urinary incontinence\\n• dizziness\\n• weight loss\\n• falling\\nTreatment\\nFor the most part, doctors prescribe medications to\\ncontrol the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-\\ned States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over take\\nmedications for various complaints. More women than\\nmen use these medications. The most common drugs\\nused by the elderly are painkillers, diuretics or water\\npills, sedatives, cardiac drugs, antibiotics , and mental\\nhealth drugs.\\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly\\nprescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms of\\naging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.\\nERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk of\\nheart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improve\\nskin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also help\\nmaintain mental functions.\\nExpected results\\nAging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-\\nment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free life\\nwell through their later years. A well established support\\nsystem of family, friends, and health care providers,\\ntogether with focus on good nutrition and lifestyle\\nhabits and good stress management, can prevent disease\\nand lessen the impact of chronic conditions.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nConsumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-\\nommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connected\\nwith aging include B vitamins , vitamins A and C, folic\\nacid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and\\ntrace minerals. Since stomach acids may be decreased, it\\nis suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-\\nmula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-\\nest to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymes\\nfor further help with digestion.\\nAntioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the\\nfree radical actions thought to contribute to problems of\\naging. They are also helpful in preventing and treating\\ncancer and in treating cataracts and glaucoma.

People with phobias feel dread or panic when they\\nface certain objects, situations, or activities. People with\\nagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, but\\npanic attacks, or panic disorder , are not a requirement\\nfor a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature of\\nagoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which\\nescape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which\\nhelp might be unavailable. The person suffering from\\nagoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-\\ntion and may become totally housebound.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAgoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and\\nit is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans within\\ntheir lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women\\nas in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.\\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, and\\nmay include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a\\nfeeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,\\nfatigue , tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid\\npulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.\\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the\\nresult of a number of physical and environmental factors.\\nFor instance, they have been associated with biochemical\\nimbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-\\nters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. People\\nwho have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-\\nping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-\\nuation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,\\nirrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-\\nflicts. All of these factors may play a role to varying\\nextents in different cases of agoraphobia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 272\\nAgoraphobia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72'),\n",

The doctor can diagnose\\nthe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make sure\\nthe symptoms aren’t related to some other underlying\\nmedical condition.\\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\\nbased primarily on the patient’s description of his or her\\nsymptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences\\nanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help is\\nunavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.\\nWhile many people are somewhat apprehensive in these\\nsituations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’s\\nactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or her\\nability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both\\nmedication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients can\\nbenefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-\\nline (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\\nsuch as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-\\nline (Zoloft).

Of these patients, 44%\\nare gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous\\ndrug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-\\nly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-\\ntion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that\\n33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide were\\nliving with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million being\\nnewly infected that year. Most of these cases are in the\\ndeveloping countries of Asia and Africa.\\nRisk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:\\n• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-\\nmous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and\\nthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms of\\nadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and\\nEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-\\ntion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas in\\nAfrica, the disease is spread primarily through sexual\\nintercourse among heterosexuals.\\n• Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers include\\nwomen married to bisexual men or men who have an\\nabnormal blood condition called hemophilia and\\nrequire blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, and\\nwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIV\\ninfection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-\\nmitting the disease to the child are higher in women in\\nadvanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increases\\nthe risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-\\ndine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decrease\\nthe risk of transmission to the baby.\\n• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\\nWith the introduction of blood product screening in the\\nmid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in blood\\ntransfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-\\nfused. With respect to HIV transmission among drug\\nabusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-\\ntions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number of\\npersons who share a needle, and the number of AIDS\\ncases in the local population.\\n• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present\\nstudies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-\\ndle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased if\\nthe injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-\\ntion, in combination with other medication.\\nHIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-\\nal non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-\\nsucking insects such as mosquitoes.\\nAIDS in women\\nAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.\\nWomen exposed to HIV infection through heterosexual\\ncontact are the most rapidly growing risk group in the\\nUnited States population. The percentage of AIDS cases\\ndiagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in\\n1999.

As of 2000, it was estimated that\\n87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%\\nof them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born\\nto HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in chil-\\ndren between one and four years of age. The interval\\nbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS is\\nshorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIV\\nhave a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a year\\nand dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-\\ngresses more slowly; the average child patient survives to\\nseven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organ\\nsystems. HIV attacks the body through three disease\\nprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\\nvous system dysfunction.\\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\\nthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is\\nnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency\\nresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein called\\nCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain\\nsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4\\ncells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the\\nvirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor\\ncalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of\\nthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-\\nlar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showed\\nthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)\\ncause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.\\nScientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-\\nment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of the\\nCCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.\\nOnce HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-\\ncellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-\\npletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-\\ncytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 75\\nAIDS\\nMature HIV-1 viruses (above) and the lymphocyte from which they emerged (below).Two immature viruses can be seen bud-\\nding on the surface of the lymphocyte (right of center).(Photograph by Scott Camazir, Photo Researchers, Inc.

Because the immune system\\ncells are destroyed, many different types of infections\\nand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened\\nimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against its\\nown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in\\nresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, protein\\nor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-\\nduces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-\\nessary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Once\\nbound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal from\\nthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. Some\\nAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-related\\nthrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), in which the number\\nof blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.\\nAs of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how\\nHIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can cause\\ndamage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theory\\nis that, once infected with HIV , one type of immune sys-\\ntem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxin\\nthat harms the nervous system.\\nThe course of AIDS generally progresses through\\nthree stages, although not all patients will follow this\\nprogression precisely:\\nAcute retroviral syndrome\\nAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe\\na group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosis\\nand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%\\nof all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients are\\nnot recognized as infected during this phase and may not\\nseek medical attention. The symptoms may include\\nfever, fatigue, muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive\\ndisturbances, weight loss, skin rashes, headache , and\\nchronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).\\nApproximately 25-33% of patients will experience a\\nform of meningitis during this phase in which the mem-\\nbranes that cover the brain and spinal cord become\\ninflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops between\\none and six weeks after infection and lasts for two to\\nthree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate\\nthe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the\\nviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease\\nbecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before\\nsymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,\\nthe virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, where\\nit may cause one or more of the following conditions:\\nPERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).\\nPersistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-\\ndition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painless\\nswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.\\nThe lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGL\\nare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.\\nPGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general\\nweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food\\nmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-\\nlism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting or\\nwasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeast\\ninfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,\\nor other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and\\nweight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and\\ndegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.\\nHIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss\\nof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness or\\nburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.\\nLate-stage disease (AIDS)\\nAIDS is usually marked by a very low number of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequency\\nof opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitor\\nthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in the\\npatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of the\\ndisease and the effectiveness of different medications.\\nAbout 10% of infected individuals never progress to this\\novert stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-\\ngressors.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm\\n3\\n, he or\\nshe is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. The\\ninfectious organisms may include the following:\\n• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated\\nwith AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).\\nPCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of\\nAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’s\\nprognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeast\\ninfection of the mouth ( candidiasis or thrush) and\\ncryptococcal meningitis.\\n• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic\\ninfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-\\nzoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasis\\nand cryptosporidiosis.\\n• Mycobacteria.

Most AIDS patients require complex\\nlong-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-\\neases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-\\nopment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-\\nrelated malignancies in the central nervous system are\\nusually treated with radiation therapy . Cancers else-\\nwhere in the body are treated with chemotherapy.\\nPROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC\\nINFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is\\ngiven to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of\\nPneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200\\ncells/mm\\n3\\nor 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush\\nshould be given prophylactic medications. The three\\ndrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-\\nsone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.\\nANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years\\nresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV\\nreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on the\\nbody. These drugs fall into three classes:\\n• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering\\nwith the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-\\ned cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. These\\ndrugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-\\ndine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-\\ndine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).\\n• Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effective\\nagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance to\\nnucleoside analogues, and are often used in combination\\nwith them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-\\navir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.\\n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is\\na new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,\\nnevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine and\\nefavirin.\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in constant\\nchange as new medications are developed and intro-\\nduced. Two principles currently guide doctors in working\\nout drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinations\\nof drugs rather than one medication alone; and basing\\ntreatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viral\\nload tests.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.\\nBecause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-\\nly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they may\\nbe given medications to stimulate blood cell production.\\nEpoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemic\\npatients. Patients with low white blood cell counts may\\nbe given filgrastim or sargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-\\nlarly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has been\\nshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into\\ntwo categories: those intended to help the immune sys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 280\\nAIDS\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80'),\n",

The use\\nof these multi-drug therapies has significantly reduced\\nthe numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting from\\nAIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potential\\nexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using these\\nand other drug therapies to boost the immune system,\\nkeep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-\\ntic infections and malignancies.\\nPrognosis after the latency period depends on the\\npatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems\\naffected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-\\nphomas of the central nervous system die within two to\\nthree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-\\nphomas may survive for eight to ten months.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against\\nAIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,\\nhowever, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as a\\ntherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing to\\nfull-blown AIDS.\\nIn the meantime, there are many things that can be\\ndone to prevent the spread of AIDS:\\n• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals\\nmust be instructed in the proper use of condoms and\\nurged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk of\\nHIV infection, condoms are successful in preventing\\nother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-\\nnancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship with\\nsomeone, get tested for HIV infection.\\n• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.\\n• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-\\ntored, those individuals who are planning to undergo\\nmajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of time\\nto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion.\\n• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-\\ncautions by wearing gloves and masks when handling\\nbody fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.\\n• If you suspect that you may have become infected, get\\ntested for HIV infection.

These\\ntests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serology\\nis the branch of immunology that deals with the contents\\nand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear light\\nyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cells\\nform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in blood\\nserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\\nPurpose\\nAIDS serology serves several different purposes.\\nSome AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-\\nfirm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-\\nsion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-\\nment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used to\\nscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes of the\\nblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to\\nunderstand how HIV infection affects human blood and\\nthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the\\nblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\\n• by sexual contact\\n• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\\nurine)\\n• by transmission during pregnancy,o r\\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-\\nin new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,\\nwhich is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white\\nblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and\\nmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and\\nkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-\\nstood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the\\nAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4\\ncells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called\\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cells\\nand B cells) in the human immune system to respond to\\ninfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce as\\nthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and B\\ncells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As\\nwith all blood tests, healthcare professionals should\\nalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked by\\nthe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, it\\nmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous\\ndrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to\\npersons in high-risk populations who may have been\\nexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms of\\nAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop a\\ndetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-\\ntion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibody\\nin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons who\\nhave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\\nthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating\\nthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,\\nhowever, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it\\ntakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. More\\ncommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-\\nence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-\\npensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting\\n99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination to\\nscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-\\nfusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test for\\nHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well or\\nbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,\\nand excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-\\npled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of a\\nsubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forming\\na color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can\\nmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived from\\nthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-\\nond antibody.\\nThe latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-\\nsitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-\\ntive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-\\nrisk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-\\ntive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of\\nthe patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is positive, the\\nresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot\\nor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to\\nconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,\\nHIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large protein\\nmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from one\\nanother by running an electric current through the gel).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 282\\nAIDS tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82'),\n",

The patient’s serum is reacted against\\nthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-\\ncals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a colored\\npatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot test\\nfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricated\\nstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s blood\\nserum and the developing chemicals. About nine different\\nHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.\\nWhen used in combination with ELISA testing,\\nWestern blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,\\nyield false negatives in patients with very early HIV\\ninfection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some\\npatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.\\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method\\nis sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of\\nWestern blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of\\nHIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-\\ning HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the\\nblood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-\\nscope with ultraviolet light.\\nPOLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is\\nused to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patients\\nwith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. These\\npatients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-\\nmatic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do not\\nhave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectable\\nquantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-\\ntive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for the\\nvery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted by\\nblood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between\\n1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.\\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-\\nsure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’s\\nblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV .\\nThis test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-\\nic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene are\\nmade by separating the two strands of DNA containing\\nthe gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-\\nmerase to make a copy, and then continuously replicating\\nthe copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replace\\nWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-\\nnoses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-\\nsons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated\\nan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming\\nmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA\\nscreening within one to three months of infection. In\\naddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of\\nthe genetic sequences in HIV . Since the virus is continual-\\nly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield a\\nfalse negative in patients with these new variants.\\nIn 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit contains\\nmultiple components, including material for specimen col-\\nlection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-\\nratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-\\nseling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.\\nThe results are obtained by the purchaser through a toll\\nfree telephone number using a personal identification\\nnumber (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over the\\ntelephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approved\\nby the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.\\nPrognostic tests\\nBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed\\nwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic\\ntests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-\\nsons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longer\\nbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patients\\nare sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomatic\\ncarriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-\\nuate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.\\nBLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the\\nnumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDS\\npatient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-\\nease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are\\nhelping the patient.

CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When the\\nHIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, it\\ndepletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killer\\ncells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most of\\nthe damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system is\\ndone by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho-\\ncytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.\\nComplete blood count (CBC) —A routine analysis\\nperformed on a sample of blood taken from the\\npatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The\\nmeasurements taken in a CBC include a white blood\\ncell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri-\\nbution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume of\\nthe red blood cells to the blood volume), and the\\namount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car-\\nries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used for\\nmany medical reasons and are not used only for\\nAIDS patients.

Two\\nforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-\\nes most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and South\\nAmerica, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, which\\nis chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-\\ncovered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-\\n1, but may also have a longer latency period.\\nImmunofluorescent assay (IFA) —A blood test\\nsometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of\\nusing the Western blotting.

This blood\\ncell count is considered the most accurate indicator\\nfor the presence of an opportunistic infection in an\\nAIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count\\nis obtained by multiplying the patient’s white blood\\ncell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytes\\namong the white blood cells, and multiplying the\\nresult by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing the\\nCD4+ marker.

Found in the viral\\ncore of HIV , p24 is a protein that can be measured by\\nthe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to\\nmeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-\\ntions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful in\\ndetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-\\ner, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of persons\\ninfected with HIV .\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-\\ntions, common in people with HIV , are causing drug\\nresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specific\\ngenetic mutations of within the virus that are known to\\ncause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.\\nFor example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine\\n(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that have\\na mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-\\nscriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V\\n(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-\\ntance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-\\nly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely to\\nrespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are only\\neffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-\\ntion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per\\nmilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually\\nbetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered by\\nmany insurance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-\\ntypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of a\\npatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.\\nTo do this, it measures the concentration of a drug\\nrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. This\\nis the same method used by researchers to determine\\nwhether a drug might be effective against HIV before\\nusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is a\\nmore direct measurement of resistance than genotypic\\ntesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-\\ning does not require a high viral load but it is recom-\\nmended that persons already be taking antiretroviral\\ndrugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now\\ncovered by many insurance plans.\\nAIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire\\nthe infection through the mother’s placenta or during the\\nbirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-\\ning and monitoring of all children born to mothers with\\nHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months\\nis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-\\nfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosed\\nby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24\\nantigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician to\\nidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and\\n95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS\\ndiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take the\\npatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-\\nstances into account and to provide counseling before and\\nafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope with\\nthe results if the doctor has spent some time with them\\nbefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIV\\ninfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type of\\ninformational counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-\\nitive, he or she will need counseling, information, referral\\nfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel the\\npatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-\\nselor to discuss the results of the blood tests with the\\npatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional and\\npsychological status, including the possibility of violent\\nbehavior and the availability of a support network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to any\\nphysical risks connected with blood testing. Some\\npatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-\\nnosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,\\nresources, belief system, and similar factors.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and\\nPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.\\nNormal results for blood cell counts:\\n• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the\\nwhite blood cells.\\n• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 286\\nAIDS tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 86'),\n",

It is probably the most specific test for\\nliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damage\\nis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since the\\namount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higher\\nALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,\\nALT levels may experience serious liver damage without\\nan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may\\nindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT\\nlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,\\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-\\ntant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,\\nwithin a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater\\nfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from\\nalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be\\ngleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from\\na vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep the\\nwound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-\\ndage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report any\\nunusual symptoms to their physician.\\nNormal results\\nNormal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nand should be available to your physician at the time of\\nthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-\\ncates many laboratories find values from approximately\\nseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nLow levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may\\nindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000\\nIU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-\\nins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually\\nresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart\\nattack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L that\\nresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the\\nbile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)\\nmay support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.\\nIt is important to note that persons with normal liv-\\ners may have slightly elevated levels of ALT.

Many types of albinism\\nexist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying\\ndegrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may\\nbe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin\\ncancer later in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five\\npeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.\\nOther parts of the world have a much higher rate; for\\nexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every\\n100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” which\\naffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,\\nhair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People\\nwith a less severe form are born with white hair and\\nskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone\\nwith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal\\nflickering eye movements ( nystagmus ) and sensitivity\\nto bright light. There may be other eye problems as\\nwell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes\\n(strabismus).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lack\\ncolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms of\\nocular albinism; some types cause more problems—\\nespecially eye problems—than others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 288\\nAlbinism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88'),\n",

Turkington\\nAlbuterol see Bronchodilators\\nAlcohol-related \\nneurologic disease\\nDefinition\\nAlcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic\\neffects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on which\\nnerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol can\\nhave far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain,\\nperipheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem-\\nory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso-\\nry deficits. These different effects can be grouped in\\nthree main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acute\\neffects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud-\\ndenly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to\\nlong-term or chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol-related\\nneurologic disease includes Wernicke-Korsakoff dis-\\nease, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, alcoholic\\nmyopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal\\nsyndrome with seizures and delirium tremens, and fetal\\nalcohol syndrome.\\nDescription\\nAcute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-\\nness (intoxication) or even death, and chronic or long-\\nterm abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage to\\nvirtually any level of the nervous system.

Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especially\\nsodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon-\\ntine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in which\\nnerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli-\\ncating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia , deliri-\\num, and movement disorder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhen a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed by\\nblood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidly\\nthroughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crosses\\nthe blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole-\\ncules from escaping from the blood vessel to the brain\\ntissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at blood\\nethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL in\\npeople who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor, coma,o r\\neven death from respiratory depression and low blood\\npressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.\\nAlthough alcohol is broken down by the liver, the\\ntoxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely a\\ndirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdown\\nproducts. The fatal dose varies widely because people\\nwho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects of\\nalcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol tolerance\\nresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol to\\nachieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-\\nhood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high and\\npotentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularly\\ntrue when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting\\ndecreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes even\\nhigher blood alcohol levels.\\nWhen a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,\\nwithdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increased\\nexcitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-\\num tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eight\\nhours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72\\nhours after abstinence. They include body shaking\\n(tremulousness), insomnia , agitation, confusion, hear-\\ning voices or seeing images that are not really there\\n(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-\\nfuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol-\\nrelated seizures may also occur without withdrawal,\\nsuch as during active heavy drinking or after more than a\\nweek without alcohol.\\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-\\nciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen in\\npeople who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-\\namine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that prevents\\nthe absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-\\ntion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;\\nthe symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-\\norientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.\\nExamination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,\\nincluding jerking of the eyes ( nystagmus ) and double\\nvision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.\\nPeople may have trouble coordinating their leg move-\\nments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not given\\npromptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-\\npor, coma, and death.\\nIf thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s\\nsyndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer\\nfrom memory impairment that leaves them unable to\\nremember events for a period of a few years before the\\nonset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to learn\\nnew information (anterograde amnesia). Most patients\\nhave very limited insight into their memory dysfunction\\nand have a tendency to make up explanations for events\\nthey have forgotten (confabulation).\\nSevere alcoholism can cause cerebellar degenera-\\ntion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions of\\nthe brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-\\nmis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, and\\nan inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. The\\ngait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, but\\nmay be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenly\\nworsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.\\nFetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to\\nalcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanol\\nretards fetal growth and development. Affected infants\\noften have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip,\\nflat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size.\\nAlmost half are mentally retarded, and most others are\\nmildly impaired intellectually or have problems with\\nspeech, learning, and behavior.\\nAlcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to\\nbreakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholic\\nrhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria.

Symptoms usually worsen over hours to a\\nfew days, and then improve over the next week to 10\\ndays as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Muscle\\nsymptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swelling\\nmay selectively involve the calves or other muscle\\ngroups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholic\\nmyopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, which\\nmay occur when people drink so much that they com-\\npress a muscle group with their body weight for a long\\ntime without moving, or by withdrawal seizures with\\ngeneralized muscle activity.\\nIn patients who abuse alcohol over many years,\\nchronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males and\\nfemales are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-\\nless weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk\\nand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,\\nshoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops\\ngradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms of\\nacute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,\\nmay be striking. The nerves of the extremities may also\\nbegin to break down, a condition known as alcoholic\\nperipheral neuropathy , which can add to the person’s\\ndifficulty in moving.\\nThe way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is\\nstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include\\nmuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-\\ncium, potassium, or other minerals ; impaired muscle\\nenergy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.\\nAlcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by the\\nliver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanol\\nis converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletal\\nmuscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver function\\nmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing the\\namount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-\\nlonged activity. Because not enough sugar is available to\\nsupply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken\\ndown as an alternate energy source. However, toxic\\neffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself\\nrather than of its breakdown products.\\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-\\ntribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the\\nmotor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholic\\nneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.\\nInjury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain\\nin the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with\\nwalking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases but\\nnumbness increases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease\\ndepends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and\\nsigns in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possible\\ncauses should be excluded by the appropriate tests,\\nwhich may include blood chemistry, thyroid function\\ntests, brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) or CT\\n(computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinal\\nfluid analysis.\\nAcute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by\\nfinding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatine\\nkinase and other blood enzymes released from injured\\nmuscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of muscle\\nfor microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows the\\nscattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-\\ntors must rule out other acquired causes of muscle\\nbreakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such as\\nheroin, cocaine , or amphetamines; trauma with crush\\ninjury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or an\\nunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates or\\nlipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatine\\nkinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-\\nphy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography\\n(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholic\\nmyopathy or neuropathy.\\nTreatment\\nAcute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium\\ntremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-\\nitor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure\\nthat may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat-\\ning may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondary\\nlow blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben-\\nzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergic\\nantagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago-\\nnists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome is\\nrapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may\\nintervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patients\\nadmitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well as\\nall patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should be\\ngiven intravenous thiamine.\\nWithdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe-\\ncific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep-\\nticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption)\\nshould be treated vigorously.

Alco-\\nholism is the popular term for two disorders, alcohol\\nabuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of both\\nthese disorders involve repeated life problems that can be\\ndirectly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-\\nders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-\\nual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impact\\non society at large.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.\\nAlcohol affects every body system, causing a wide range\\nof health problems. Some such problems include poor\\nnutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance and\\nwalking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis),\\nhigh blood pressure, muscle weakness (including the\\nheart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-\\nders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinal\\ninflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problems\\nwith the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-\\ntent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-\\nened bones.\\nOn a personal level, alcoholism results in marital\\nand other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-\\nment, child abuse, and general family dysfunction.\\nAlcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of\\nsevere social problems including homelessness, murder,\\nsuicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-\\ning factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-\\ncle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur each\\nyear due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are due\\nto injuries of some sort. According to a recent special\\nreport prepared for the U.S. Congress by the National\\nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impact\\nof alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-\\ndents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs\\nour nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-\\ntion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-\\ndren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to\\n17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-\\nhol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, it\\nhas been estimated that approximately 18 percent of\\nadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-\\ndence a some time during their lives.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are probably a number of factors that work\\ntogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.\\nRecent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-\\natives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to\\nbecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk\\nholds true even for children who were adopted away\\nfrom their biological families at birth and raised in a\\nnon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge of\\ntheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More\\nresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-\\ntors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-\\nlism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-\\ning an alcoholic.\\nThe symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol\\nuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The\\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-\\ning the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly\\nbecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level.

The affected person may also have impairment of\\nperiperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s\\nbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting\\nmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed\\ninto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including the\\npossibility of pneumonia ). Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually every\\norgan system of the body:\\n• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in\\ntheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic\\nblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantity\\nof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the time\\nsurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-\\nknown to cause sleep disturbances, so that overall\\nsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may\\noccur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which can\\noccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’s\\nand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the low\\nthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels found\\nin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-\\ndered eye movements, very poor balance and difficulty\\nwalking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely\\naffects one’s memory, preventing new learning from\\ntaking place.\\n• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of\\nthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contents\\nfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acid\\nfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-\\ngus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and\\nbleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also result\\nin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. A\\nmajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-\\norrhage) in an alcoholic is the development of\\nenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,\\nwhich are called esophageal varices. These varices are\\nactually developed in response to liver disease, and\\nare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.\\nDiarrhea is a common symptom, due to alcohol’s\\neffect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation of\\nthe pancreas ( pancreatitis ) is a serious and painful\\nproblem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,\\nalcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,\\ncreating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-\\nken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ is\\nseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-\\nhol interferes with a number of important chemical\\nprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver begins\\nto enlarge and fill with fat ( fatty liver ), fibrous scar\\ntissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and\\nfunction (cirrhosis), and the liver may become\\ninflamed (hepatitis).\\n• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of\\nblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally\\nlarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-\\ntions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened\\nimmune system. This places alcoholics at increased\\nrisk for infections, and is thought to account in part\\nfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics\\n(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and blood\\nclotting factors are affected, causing an increased risk\\nof bleeding.\\n• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood\\npressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins to\\nincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. High\\nlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase the\\nrisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in an\\nincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,\\nabnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots forming\\nwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatly\\nincreased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the\\nheart entering the circulatory system, going to the\\nbrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).\\n• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative\\neffect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-\\ning testicle and ovary size, and interfering with both\\nsperm and egg production. When pregnancy is\\nachieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a great\\nrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which\\ncauses distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, and\\nbehavioral problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nTwo different types of alcohol-related difficulties\\nhave been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-\\ndence, which refers to a person who literally depends on\\nthe use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must be\\npresent to diagnose alcohol dependence:\\n• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed\\nto a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase the\\ndose in order to obtain the desired effect\\n• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences\\nunpleasant physical and psychological symptoms when\\nhe or she does not drink alcohol\\n• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends\\n(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-\\nficult to stop)\\n• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once\\nstarted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 296\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96'),\n",

A clinician may begin to be suspicious\\nwhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins to\\nexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-\\nhol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of a\\nphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.\\nDiagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-\\nlogical assessments that try to determine what aspects of\\na person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-\\nhol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-\\nson drinks is of much less importance than determining\\nhow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-\\ntional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-\\nlism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-\\nes alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-\\nsumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing either\\nalcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.\\nOne very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists\\nof four questions, with the first letters of each key word\\nspelling out the word CAGE:\\n• Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking?\\n• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?\\n• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day)?\\nOther, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-\\nmine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.\\nGiven the recent research pointing to a genetic basis\\nfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whether\\nanyone else in the person’s family has ever suffered\\nfrom alcoholism.\\nPhysical examination may reveal signs suggestive\\nof alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible network\\nof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel\\n(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen ( ascites);\\nyellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size in\\nmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal an\\nincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalities\\nin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fighting\\ninfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-\\nting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step\\nin the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification,\\ninvolves helping the person stop drinking and ridding his\\nor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.\\nBecause the person’s body has become accustomed to\\nalcohol, the person will need to be supported through\\nwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for different\\npatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as\\nmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and the\\nlength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-\\ndrawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.\\nMild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-\\nrhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety, and trem-\\nbling. This phase is usually over in about three to five\\ndays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-\\ncinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable\\ncraving for more alcohol, confusion,fever, fast heart rate,\\nhigh blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of\\nconsciousness).

No medications are necessary,\\nhowever. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severe\\neffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-\\nications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and to\\navoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high\\nblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs called\\nbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients suffering\\nfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids\\nmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), along\\nwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-\\namine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually\\nquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamine\\nis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\\nAfter cessation of drinking has been accomplished,\\nthe next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-\\ning another drink. This phase of treatment is referred to\\nas rehabilitation . The best programs incorporate the\\nfamily into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-\\nedly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.\\nSome therapists believe that family members, in an effort\\nto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-\\ntimes develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-\\nport or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation is\\nreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed in\\norder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.\\nSessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics\\nmeet regularly and provide support for each other’s\\nrecoveries, are considered some of the best methods of\\npreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the\\nmost well-known such group is called Alcoholics\\nAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-\\nple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing the\\ndestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-\\nholic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-\\ncoming the problem, and reflecting on the ways in\\nwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-\\nble, making amends to those people. According to a\\nrecent study reported by the American Psychological\\nAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or her\\nreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefit\\nfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-\\nholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous\\n(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groups\\nexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-\\nsionals combined.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been used\\nwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug\\nwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-\\ntions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.\\nNaltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,\\ncan be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-\\nprosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of these\\nmedications would be helpful unless the patient was also\\nwilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the\\nalcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawal\\nhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressful\\nlives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is\\nsometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments for\\nalcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. These\\ninclude massage, meditation, and hypnotherapy. The\\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-\\ntion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a\\nhealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as\\nvitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty\\nacids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal\\ntreatments include milk thistle(Silybum marianum), which\\nis thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs\\nare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering through\\nwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender ( Lavandula\\nofficinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile\\n(Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha piperita )\\nyarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and valerian ( Valeriana\\nofficinalis). Acupuncture is believed to both decrease\\nwithdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’s\\nchances for continued recovery from alcoholism.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In\\nfact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-\\naged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-\\nholic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because most\\nresearchers in the field believe that since the potential for\\nalcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological and\\npsychological makeup, one can never fully recover from\\nalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)\\nis always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.\\nStatistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics in\\nstable financial and family situations who have undergone\\ntreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt to\\nstop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention must begin at a relatively young age\\nsince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 298\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 98'),\n",

Like all enzymes, it is needed to\\ntrigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus-\\ncle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to\\ndiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.\\nPurpose\\nSkeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level\\nfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those\\nmuscles attached to bones and whose contractions make\\nthose bones move. When the muscles are diseased or\\ndamaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the cells dete-\\nriorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-\\ning aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring the\\namount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of\\nmuscle damage.\\nAs muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels\\ndecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle\\nmeans fewer cells and less aldolase.\\nMuscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as\\nwell as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolase\\nlevels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will be\\nnormal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi-\\ncal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis ,\\nbut aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of muscular\\ndisease, such as muscular dystrophy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 99\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 99'),\n",

Secondary aldosteronism is\\nmore common and may occur with congestive heart fail-\\nure, cirrhosis with fluid in the abdominal cavity\\n(ascites ), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,\\nsodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy.\\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-\\nondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-\\nformed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,\\nan enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondary\\naldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.\\nDescription\\nAldosterone testing can be performed on a blood\\nsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,\\nincluding diet, posture (upright or lying down), and time\\nof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosterone\\nlevels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-\\nterm fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over an\\nentire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-\\nfering factors and provides a more reliable aldosterone\\nmeasurement.\\nPreparation\\nFasting is not required for either the blood sample\\nor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-\\nmal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for at\\nleast two weeks before either test. The doctor should\\ndecide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluid\\nbalance (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensives, steroids, oral\\ncontraceptives ) should be withheld.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-\\nbody that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found on\\nthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that is\\nused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cells\\nof patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocytic\\nleukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat\\nB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronic\\nleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found on\\nthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immune\\nsystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant B\\ncells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-\\ntion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-\\nbody-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that the\\nimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease to\\nbe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-\\ndarabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,\\nthis drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-\\nments for B-CLL another option. As most patients with\\nB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylating\\nagents and fludarabine have been tried, the experience\\nwith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with those\\nstages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% of\\npatients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% of\\nthese being complete responses.\\nThis antibody has been tested with limited success\\nin the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and\\nfor the preparation of patients with various immune cell\\nmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There is\\nalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-\\nbody to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.\\nDescription\\nAlemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using\\ngenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like all\\nantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-\\nular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.\\nFor alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein found\\non the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells as\\nwell as other cells of the immune and male reproductive\\nsystems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-\\ning that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips of\\nthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but the\\nrest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of\\nthe human sequences helps to reduce the immune\\nresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, a\\nproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are used\\nfor cancer therapies. The human sequences also help to\\nensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of\\nthe human immune system are properly triggered with\\nbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use\\nalone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-\\nbody to be used in combination with the purine analogs\\npentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, a\\nmonoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,\\nanother protein found on the surface of B cells.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThis antibody should be administered in a gradually\\nescalating pattern at the start of treatment and any time\\nadministration is interrupted for seven or more days. The\\nrecommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is a\\ndaily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-\\nhour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the dose\\nis increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,\\nit can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a\\nweek. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-\\nchoride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-\\nsion to help reduce side effects.\\nAdditionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-\\ntive medication before treatment to help minimize the\\nserious opportunistic infections that can result from this\\ntreatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\\n(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-\\nvent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to\\ndecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.\\nPrecautions\\nBlood studies should be done on a weekly basis\\nwhile patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-\\nment. Vaccination during the treatment session is not\\nrecommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs\\nduring treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies\\nlike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the\\ndeveloping fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-\\nnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless\\nclearly needed.\\nSide effects\\nA severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the\\npossible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2102\\nAlemtuzumab\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102'),\n",

He became an actor and Shake-\\nspearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suffer\\nfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-\\ntion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with a\\nrecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,\\nhis problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began about\\nan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it\\nwas something he did in the process of reciting that\\ncaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical\\ndoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the\\ndoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was\\ndoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try\\nand find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his\\ncoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One of\\nhis most startling discoveries was that in order to change\\nthe way he used his body he had to change the way he\\nwas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way that\\nhe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-\\ned speech or movement. After making this discovery at\\nthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a\\npioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and\\nto improve the expression and spontaneity of their\\nperformances. Soon a great number of people sought\\nhelp from his teaching for a variety of physical and\\nmental disorders.\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-\\non-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or\\nworkshops for special applications of the technique\\n(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-\\nvate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,\\nand are taught in a series. The number of lessons varies\\naccording to the severity of the student’s difficulties\\nwith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-\\nest in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-\\ntinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 per\\nhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, but\\ndiscounts are available for participants in some comple-\\nmentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible Spending\\nAccounts for health care cover Alexander technique\\nlessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortable\\nclothing) and use their hands to help students identify\\nand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arises\\nfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussions\\nof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in the\\ncourse of a lesson.\\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-\\nment (the lessons are a series of movements), most\\npeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulders\\ntoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten\\ntheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension in\\ntheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse of\\nthe body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, the\\nhead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply\\nbecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out of\\nbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series of\\nstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It is\\nskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity in\\nthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathing\\nmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons in\\nthe technique aim to develop.\\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short period\\nof time it took to complete a single movement. People,\\nespecially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-\\nated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles is\\ncommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-\\nvisions or video monitors, too much sitting or driving\\nand too little walking, or by tension associated with past\\ntraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after a\\nwhiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg\\nlong after it has healed are examples of habitual tension\\ncaused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-\\nnique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness\\nof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in\\nthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibit\\nthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, for\\nexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.\\nIf he is asked to put aside the intention to sit and\\ninstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2104\\nAlexander technique\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104'),\n",

In Alexander lessons stu-\\ndents learn to direct themselves this way in activity and\\nbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.\\nPrecautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.\\nTeachers use their hands simply to gently guide students\\nin movement. Therefore, both contraindications and\\npotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-\\nmum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-\\nture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the case\\nof errors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the\\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more acutely\\naware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn to\\nrelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustain\\nthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-\\nness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused\\nby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened and\\nreleased muscles and the expanded range of movement\\nin the joints.\\nOccasionally students may get light-headed during a\\nlesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-\\nlatory or respiratory functioning.\\nForceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures\\noften indicate suppression of emotion. As muscles\\nrelease during or after an Alexander lesson, students may\\nexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changes\\nin mood.

Like all enzymes, it is needed, in small\\namounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it\\nis present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liver\\ndisease or a tumor.\\nPurpose\\nMedical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned\\nwith the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,\\nand intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline\\nphosphate and other substances is continually drained\\naway through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bile\\nduct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.\\nAlkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually\\nescapes into the bloodstream.\\nThe alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by\\nthe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.\\nIts origin differs from that of other enzymes called\\naminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of an\\nobstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliary\\ndrainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be the\\nfirst and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the other\\nhand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-\\ncytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,\\nthese enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the type\\nof liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.\\nGrowing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-\\ndition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphatase\\nlevels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as a\\nchildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;\\nor the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer,\\nPaget’s disease, or rickets.\\nDuring pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made by\\nthe placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.\\nThis is normal. Some tumors, however, start production\\nof the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by the\\nplacenta. These tumors are called germ cell tumors and\\ninclude testicular cancer and certain brain tumors.\\nAlkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increased\\nin a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as\\nulcerative colitis.\\nDescription\\nAlkaline phosphatase is measured by combining the\\nperson’s serum with specific substances with which alka-\\nline phosphatase is known to react. The end product of\\nthis reaction is measured; and from that measurement,\\nthe amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serum\\nis determined.\\nEach tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—\\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. These\\nvariations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-\\nline phosphatase is measured as the total amount or the\\namount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-\\nzymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and\\nother processes in the laboratory. Methods to measure\\nthem separately are based on these differences.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary. Results are usually available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upper\\narm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts\\na needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the blood\\nthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection of\\nthe sample takes only a few minutes.\\nA person being tested for alkaline phosphatase\\nshouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, for\\neight to ten hours before the test. Some people release\\nalkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the blood-\\nstream after eating. This will temporarily increase the\\nresult of the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site\\nor the person may feel dizzy or faint.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction\\nthat occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this\\nspecific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes\\ngrouped together with other lung disorders characterized\\nby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain type\\nof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading of\\neosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also called\\nhypersensitivity lung diseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are not\\nclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-\\nics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-\\ntaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found\\nworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,\\nforests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.\\nThey are also found on wet paint, construction materials,\\nand in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial\\ninfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-\\npital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,\\nthe bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the\\npatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes or\\ncoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-grade\\nfever and lose their appetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis.\\nThey may also develop a serious long-term form of\\nbronchiectasis , the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 107\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107'),\n",

ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-\\nplication of cystic fibrosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of\\nthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputum\\ntests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor will\\nbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-\\nening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other\\nlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-\\nnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n• a history of asthma.\\n• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a\\nchest x ray.\\n• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n• skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.\\n• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.\\n• Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-\\nitins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form a\\nsolid that separates from the rest of the solution in the\\ntest tube.\\n• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a\\nclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergic\\nreactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the diag-\\nnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of\\nthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brown\\nmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a complete blood count (CBC), a\\nsputum culture , a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer\\nof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches\\nbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgE\\nantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what is\\ncalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-\\nutes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized by\\nthe eruption of a reddened, itching spot on the skin.\\nSome patients with ABPA will develop the so-called\\nlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,\\nswollen area develops about six to eight hours after the\\ninitial reaction.\\nAspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro-\\nscope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-\\nnosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-\\ntured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and\\ncan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-\\nSchiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)\\npreparations.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the\\npresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs of\\nbronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-\\ncorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and\\nwith bronchodilators.\\nAntifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA because\\nit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather\\nthan by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic\\ncheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A\\nspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’s\\nlung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-\\nteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-\\nual improvement over time. The best indicator of a good\\nprognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.\\nPatients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-\\nop severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a\\ncommon fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputum\\nof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-\\ntect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-\\npost piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet or\\nrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites or\\nnewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-\\ntioners cleaned regularly.

The skin is\\nthe most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-\\ntestinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.\\nAP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-\\ned States each year. Most cases are children between the\\nages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often than\\ngirls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-\\ncial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are\\ndesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.\\nIn some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can\\nbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-\\nstream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and\\nbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-\\nillary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-\\ntion. More than 75% of patients report having had an\\ninfection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-\\ntrointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.\\nOther complex molecules can act as antigens as well,\\nincluding drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines. Other-\\nwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-\\ntion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may\\ncause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,\\nand quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include\\nthose for typhoid, measles, cholera, and yellow fever.\\nSymptoms\\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache ,\\nfever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an\\nitchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, and\\nmay be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-\\ner, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple and then\\nrust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-\\neral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,\\nabdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on the\\nbody may also occur, especially in younger children.\\nJoint pain and swelling is common, especially in\\nthe knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almost\\nall patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).\\nAbout half of all patients show blood in the urine, low\\nurine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.\\nKidney failure may occur due to widespread obstruction\\nof the capillaries in the filtering structures called\\nglomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of all\\npatients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-\\ntein in the urine.\\nLess common symptoms include prolonged head-\\nache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-\\nment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas\\n(pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their\\ndevelopment, a careful medical history, and blood and\\nurine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans (CT)\\nmay be performed to assess complications in the bowel\\nor other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of AP resolve completely without treat-\\nment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because of\\nthe possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin pain\\nrelievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids(like\\nprednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-\\nists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requires\\nmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.\\nPatients with severe kidney complications may\\nrequire a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.\\nEven after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels of\\nblood or protein in the urine may persist for months and\\nrequire regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney fail-\\nure may develop months or even years after the acute\\nphase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis or\\ntransplantation.\\nPlasmapheresis , which removes antibodies from\\nthe blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people who develop AP become better on their\\nown after several weeks.

It affects between 10-20% of all people in\\nthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-\\ntor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat\\nallergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both\\nprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and\\nperennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,\\nand early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at their\\nhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-\\nnomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause of\\nsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all year\\nand is usually caused by home or workplace airborne\\npollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.\\nSymptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-\\ndoors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after\\nspending time indoors.\\nBoth types of allergies can develop at any age,\\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood is\\nmost common. Although allergy to a particular substance\\nis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run in\\nthe family.” While allergies can improve on their own\\nover time, they can also become worse over time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-\\nganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producing\\nspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable of\\nbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-\\neign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen\\nsets off a series of reactions designed to protect the body\\nfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions\\nis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is the\\ncondition known as allergy, and the offending substance\\nis called an allergen.\\nLike all allergic reactions, AR involves a special\\nset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.\\nMast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages\\nand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called\\nimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,\\nmast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,\\ncalled granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-\\ngens, they trigger release of the granules, which spill\\nout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including\\nblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,\\nhistamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,\\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\\nInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-\\nsels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leading\\nto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased redness\\ncharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.\\nHistamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the\\nitchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-\\ngic rhinitis.\\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is enor-\\nmous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grass\\nand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in large\\namounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,\\nlike roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a sticky\\npollen which is less likely to become airborne. Different\\nplants release their pollen at different times of the year,\\nso seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,\\nsummer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke a\\nresponse.

House dust contains some or\\nall of the following:\\n• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-\\nbers of microscopic insects called house mites. These\\nharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by\\nthe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-\\nly become airborne.\\n• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,\\nand dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred from\\npet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergy\\nin many sensitive people.\\n• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout the\\nhouse, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, air\\nconditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,\\nmattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and other\\nmolds release airborne spores which circulate through-\\nout the house.\\nOther potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis\\ninclude the following:\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• perfume\\n• cosmetics\\n• cleansers\\n• copier chemicals\\n• industrial chemicals\\n• construction material gases\\nSymptoms\\nInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major\\nsymptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching, sneezing,\\nrunny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling can\\nconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner ear\\nto the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-\\nping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the back\\nof the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, can\\nalso lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually also\\ncauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and\\nheadache are also common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can\\noften be done without a medical specialist. When symp-\\ntoms appear in spring or summer and disappear with the\\nonset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainly\\nthe culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,\\ncan usually be ruled out by a physical examination and\\na nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on a\\nswab for examination.\\nAllergy tests , including skin testing and provoca-\\ntion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, but\\nmay not be done unless a single source is suspected and\\nsubsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involves\\nplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specific\\nallergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,\\nor injecting it into the skin surface to observe whether\\nredness and swelling occurs. Provocation testing\\ninvolves challenging an individual with either a small\\namount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a\\nresponse is elicited.\\nPerennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-\\nful questioning about the timing of exposure and the\\nonset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identified\\nthrough allergy skin testing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2112\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nThis illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the\\nnose after inhalation of airborne pollen.

When it is not possible to avoid\\none or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-\\nical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.\\nDrugs\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of\\nhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used after\\nsymptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-\\ntive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. A\\nwide variety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a\\nmajor side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-\\nlowing:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)\\n• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\\n• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\\n• clemastine (Tavist and generics).\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nare available by prescription and include the following:\\n• astemizole (Hismanal)\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\n• fexofenadine (Allegra)\\n• azelastin HCl (Astelin).\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery-\\nthromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-\\nconazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more\\nthan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause\\narrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-\\ndrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from\\nthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of\\nthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-\\nly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal sprays\\nare available that can be applied directly to the nasal lining\\nand oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestants\\nare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and blood\\npressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-\\ntants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-\\nness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passages\\nbecome more severely swollen than before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos-\\nteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse\\nas the season progresses because the immune system\\nbecomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-\\nduce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids\\nare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-\\nzation because they work more slowly and last longer\\nthan most other medication types. As a result, they are\\nbest started before allergy season begins. Side effects are\\nusually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,\\nand unpleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents\\nthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing\\nrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained in\\nthem. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-\\nal weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can be\\nused for perennial AR as well.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the\\nbody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic\\nreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing\\nto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections\\ninvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts of\\nallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic\\nboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to\\nachieve and are not seen at all in about one in five\\npatients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored\\nclosely following each shot because of the small risk of\\nanaphylaxis , a condition that can result in difficulty\\nbreathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AR often focus on modu-\\nlation of the body’s immune response, and frequently\\ncenter around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chinese\\nherbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, as\\ncan both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment.\\nVitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize the\\nmucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west-\\nern herbal remedies including eyebright ( Euphrasia\\nofficinalis ) and nettle ( Urtica dioica ) may be helpful.\\nBee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi-\\nnating AR symptoms.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people with AR can achieve adequate relief\\nwith a combination of preventive strategies and treat-\\nment. While allergies may improve over time, they may\\nalso get worse or expand to include new allergens. Early\\ntreatment can help prevent an increased sensitization to\\nother allergens.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 113\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 113'),\n",

It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or\\nmore than one in every five people, suffer from some\\nform of allergy, with similar proportions throughout\\nmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largest\\nreason for school absence and is a major source of lost\\nproductivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganisms\\nor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-\\nbodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-\\ntifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.\\nThis reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a\\nseries of chemical reactions designed to protect the\\nbody from infection. Sometimes, this same series of\\nreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances\\nsuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When this\\noccurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-\\nstance (an allergen.)\\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-\\ntions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,\\ncalled immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-\\ngens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets\\ncalled granules. Granules contain a variety of potent\\nchemicals, including histamine.\\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into two\\nmain types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which\\nare predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur within\\nminutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of white\\nblood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.\\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-\\nate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-\\nbodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-\\ntents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-\\ning blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to the\\nsurfaces of these other cells through special proteins\\ncalled histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with\\nreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,\\nleading to the fluid collection, swelling and increased\\nredness. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, mak-\\ning tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms last\\nfrom one to several hours following contact.\\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-\\nshot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation of\\nthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping and\\ndiarrhea typical of food allergy. Allergens that enter the\\ncirculation may cause hives, angioedema, anaphylaxis,\\nor atopic dermatitis.\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,\\nsetting in motion a more prolonged immune response.\\nThis type of allergic response may develop over several\\ndays following contact with the allergen, and symptoms\\nmay persist for a week or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergens enter the body through four main routes:\\nthe airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the\\ncirculatory system.\\n• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,\\nand itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhini-\\ntis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the\\nlungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes,\\ncausing conjunctivitis (pink eye). Exposure to cock-\\nroach allergans have been associated with the devel-\\nopment of asthma. Airborne allergans from household\\npets are another common source of environmental\\nexposure.\\n• Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the\\nlips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbed\\ninto the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)\\nor more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-\\ninflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,\\norgans, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergens\\nmay cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threatening\\ncondition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-\\ntion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods such\\ncow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and\\nsoybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-\\nbles may also occur.\\n• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-\\ning, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis .\\nSkin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-\\nduced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.\\nThis type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis .\\nDermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such\\nas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causing\\nnonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,\\nand chemical agents).\\n• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or\\ndrug administration, can introduce allergens directly\\ninto the circulation, where they may cause system-wide\\nresponses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the local\\nones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.\\nPeople with allergies are not equally sensitive to\\nall allergens.

Allergies may\\nget worse over time. For example, childhood ragweed\\nallergy may progress to year-round dust and pollen\\nallergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergic\\nsensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-\\npears in almost all people. More commonly, what\\nseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reduced\\nexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for the\\nsame level of symptoms.\\nWhile allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,\\nthe likelihood of developing some type of allergy seems\\nto be, at least for many people. If neither parent has\\nallergies, the chances of a child developing allergy is\\napproximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is\\n30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.One\\nsource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability to\\nproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.\\nThose who produce more IgE will develop a stronger\\nallergic sensitivity.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne\\nallergens are the following:\\n• plant pollens\\n• animal fur and dander\\n• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n• house dust\\n• mold spores\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• solvents\\n• cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish\\n• eggs\\n• wheat\\n• milk\\n• food additives and preservatives\\nThe following types of drugs commonly cause aller-\\ngic reactions:\\n• penicillin or other antibiotics\\n• flu vaccines\\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine\\n• gamma globulin\\nCommon causes of contact dermatitis include the\\nfollowing:\\n• poison ivy, oak, and sumac\\n• nickel or nickel alloys\\n• latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n• bees, wasps, and hornets\\n• mosquitoes\\n• fleas\\n• scabies\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic\\nreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,\\nrunny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat due\\nto post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane\\ncovering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,\\nirritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-\\nes wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symp-\\ntoms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-\\ntive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-\\ntemically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinal\\nsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,\\ntongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; and\\ngas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,\\nweepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. It\\nsometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such as\\na glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,\\nwrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-\\nlobes by wearing earrings.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common following\\ningestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions\\ninclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called\\nhives that characteristically blanch with pressure and\\nresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more\\nextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid\\ncollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually\\noccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the\\nhead,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway\\nconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue\\nswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,\\nloss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include, dizzi-\\nness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-\\ning.

Allergy is suspected if\\nthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergic\\nreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure to\\nthe suspected allergan. Allergy tests can be used to\\nidentify potential allergens, but these must be supported\\nby eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-\\ncal history.\\nSkin tests\\nSkin tests are performed by administering a tiny\\ndose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,\\npuncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is applied\\nto the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,\\nforearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-\\ngen may produce a classic immune wheal and flare\\nresponse (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressible\\narea surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually begin\\nwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to\\nsmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. A\\npositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-\\ngen is at levels normally encountered in food or in the\\nairways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximately\\nfifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin tests\\ninvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of the\\nskin. These tests are more sensitive and are used for\\nallergies associated with risk of death, such as allergies\\nto antibiotics.\\nAllergen-Specific IgE Measurement\\nTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies\\ngenerally follow a basic method. The allergen is bound\\nto a solid support, either in the form of a cellulose\\nsponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’s\\nserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubated\\nwith the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodies\\nare present, they will bind to the solid phase and be\\nretained there when the rest of the serum is washed\\naway. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is added\\nand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase.

Some\\nresearch indicates that there is a higher level of total\\nserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-\\nple. However, this may not always be the case as there is\\nconsiderable overlap between the two groups.This test is\\nuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and\\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis . Other conditions that\\nare not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-\\nels such as smoking , AIDS, infection with parasites,\\nand IgE myeloma.\\nProvocation tests\\nThese tests involve the administration of allergen to\\nellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-\\nmonly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen\\ndirectly through the route normally involved. Delayed\\nallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar\\nmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen to\\ninduce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-\\ntion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen for\\ntwo weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measured\\namount of the test substance administered as an opaque\\ncapsule along with a placebo control. Provocation tests\\nare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to the\\npatient’s medical history.\\nFuture diagnostic methods\\nAs of 2000, attempts have been made for direct\\nmeasurement of immune mediators such as histamine,\\neosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast cell\\ntryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-\\ntrodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.\\nThis test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-\\ntion in the United States, though not approved by the\\nFood and Drug Administration. An electric potential is\\napplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-\\ntrical resistance observed for changes. This method has\\nnot been verified.\\nTreatment\\nAvoiding allergens is the first line of defense to\\nreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful to\\navoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,\\nperfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, air\\nfresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorly\\nvented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-\\nplaces has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dust\\nmite control is particularly important in the bedroom\\nareas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattress\\nand pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hot\\nwater,and removal of items that collect dust such as\\nstuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducing\\nindoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduce\\nindoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-\\ntems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such as\\nthe bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals should\\navoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,\\nurine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,\\nrestriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of the\\nhome may be beneficial.\\nComplete environmental control is often difficult to\\naccomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may\\nbecome necessary. A large number of prescription and\\nover-the-counter drugs are available for treatment of\\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of these\\nwork by decreasing the ability of histamine to provoke\\nsymptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-\\nmine by stimulating other systems or reducing immune\\nresponses in general.\\nAntihistamines\\nAntihistamines block the histamine receptors on\\nnasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine released\\nby mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,\\nthough they may be even more effective when used pre-\\nventively, before symptoms appear.

Paticular care should be taken to assess the\\naffected individual’s airway status, and he or she should\\nbe placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter-\\nmined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or an\\ninjection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximal\\nto the area where the agent penetrated the skin. This\\nshould then be released at intervals of ten minutes at a\\ntime, for one to two minutes duration. If the individual\\ndoes not respond to such interventions, then emergency\\ntreatment is appropriate.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAny alternative treatment for allergies begins with\\nfinding the cause and then helping the patient to avoid\\nor eliminate the allergen, although this is not always\\npossible. As with any alternative therapy, a physician\\nshould be consulted before initiating a new form of\\ntreatment. Education on the use of alternative agents is\\ncritical, as they are still “drugs” even though they are\\nderived from natural sources.Various categories of\\nalternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-\\nment, including:\\n• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-\\nperidin act as natural anithistamines.\\n• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies\\nFerrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum (used alter-\\nnately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteine\\nare believed to have decongestant effects.\\n• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and\\nhesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.\\n• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea (Echinacea spp.)\\nand astragalus or milk-vetch root ( Astragalus mem-\\nbranaceus ) may possibly help to strengthen the\\nimmune system.\\n• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra (Ephedra\\nsinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine), khellin ( Ammi visnaga ) and cramp bark\\n(Viburnum opulus) are believed to help open the airways.\\nTreatment of contact dermatitis\\nA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-\\nly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-\\nment of contact dermatitis.

Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-\\nganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producing\\nspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable of\\nbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the\\nforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody and\\nantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protect\\nthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of\\nreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.\\nThis is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-\\ning substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled\\nallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tiny\\nhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,\\nand milk.\\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells in\\nthe immune system known as mast cells. Mast cells\\nserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets the\\noutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of the\\neyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory\\nand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special type\\nof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on\\ntheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicals\\nin small packets, called granules. When the antibodies\\nencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,\\nwhich spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,\\nincluding blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these\\nchemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these\\nother cells, through special proteins called histamine\\nreceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on\\nblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,\\nleading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased\\nredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated\\neyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing\\nthe itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in\\nallergic rhinitis.\\nThe particular allergens to which a person is sensi-\\ntive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergy\\ntests may be performed on the skin or using blood serum\\nin a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens are\\nplaced on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-\\nallergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s blood\\nserum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-\\nmine if serum antibodies react with the allergen.

Positive reac-\\ntions from any of these tests may be used to narrow the\\ncandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.\\nIdentification of the allergenic substance may allow\\nthe patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergic\\nreactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done in\\nthose with asthma that is difficult to manage, eczema, or\\nskin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con-\\ndition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be done\\nbefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of\\nmore extensive exposure.\\nSkin testing is the most common type of allergy test.\\nThere are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In\\npercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are\\nplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a\\nneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and\\nbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which\\nthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less\\noften. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting\\nallergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,\\nswollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-\\nstance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity is\\nseen for allergens regardless of whether they usually\\naffect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-\\ngens cause skin reactions equally well.\\nThe range of allergens used for testing is chosen to\\nreflect possible sources in the environment and may\\ninclude the following:\\n• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and\\nweeds\\n• mold and fungus spores\\n• house dust\\n• house mites\\n• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva\\n• food extracts\\n• antibiotics\\n• insect venoms\\nRadio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory\\ntest performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk\\nskin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-\\nvent it.\\nProvocation testing is done to positively identify\\nsuspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-\\nfied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested in\\nincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provoke\\na response. Food testing is much more tedious than\\ninhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-\\ntive system may take a day or more.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile allergy tests are quite safe for most people,\\nthe possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does\\nexist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition\\nthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in\\nblood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-\\nlaxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin tests\\nshould never include a substance known to cause ana-\\nphylaxis in the person being tested.\\nProvocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.\\nTherefore, treatment medications should be available fol-\\nlowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.\\nDescription\\nIn prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested\\nis placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.\\nA typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen\\ndrops, including a drop of saline solution that should not\\nprovoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-\\nmine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A\\nsmall needle is inserted through the drop, and used to\\nprick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.\\nThe sites are examined over the next twenty minutes for\\nevidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positive\\nreaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-\\ntions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.\\nSimilarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are\\nmade for each allergen tested. Observations are made\\nover the next twenty minutes.\\nIn RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in\\nthe laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum is\\nseparated from the blood cells.

Some causes are considered natural, while oth-\\ners signal serious health problems. Some conditions are\\nconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughout\\nthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-\\nnents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in the\\nbody.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp\\nwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific cause\\nis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-\\nness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, or\\nhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is the\\ncondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimes\\nonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visibly\\ndiseased as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\n• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-\\nered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized by\\nthe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of the\\nhead and by the healthy condition of the scalp.\\n• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown\\ncause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.\\n• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair\\nloss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s\\nfoot and ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.\\n• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that\\ncauses a person to pull out his/her own hair.\\n• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer\\nchemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.\\nPlacing a tourniquet around the skull just above the ears\\nduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs may\\nreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugs\\nfrom reaching the scalp.\\n• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-\\ntively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One example\\nis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism (too much thy-\\nroid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 125\\nAlopecia\\nTop of balding male’s head.(Photograph by Kelly A.

This screening test mea-\\nsures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-\\ncates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-\\nous birth defects . The level of AFP can also be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. This\\nscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; it\\nonly indicates the increase of risk for several birth\\ndefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detect\\nliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitor\\nthe progress of cancer treatment.\\nPurpose\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the\\nliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is\\nunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing\\nAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.\\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and\\nsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enter\\nthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. By\\nanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-\\notic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probability\\nthat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is very\\nimportant that the doctor know precisely how old the\\nfetus is when the test is performed since the AFP level\\nchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFP\\nscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test is\\nused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate line\\nof testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows,\\nbased on the results.\\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus\\nhas an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the most\\ncommon and severe type of disorder associated with\\nincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinal\\ncolumn defects ( spina bifida ) and anencephaly (a\\nsevere and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tube\\nthat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not close\\ncorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leak\\nthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amniotic\\nfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels of\\nAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If the\\nscreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-\\nsound is used to diagnosis the problem.\\nOther fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels\\nabove normal include:\\n• cysts at the end of the spine\\n• blockage in the esophagus or intestines\\n• liver disease causing liver cells to die\\n• defects in the abdominal wall\\n• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease\\n• brittle bone disease\\nLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid in\\nthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-\\noping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along than\\nestimated.\\nFor unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may\\nindicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down\\nsyndrome . Down syndrome is a condition that\\nincludes mental retardation and a distinctive physical\\nappearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome\\n21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates\\nan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-\\nnosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP can\\nalso occur when the fetus has died or when the mother\\nis overweight.\\nAFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that\\nanalyzes three substances as risk indicators of possible\\nbirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic\\ngonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-\\nsured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the test\\nresults increases.\\nAlthough AFP in human blood gradually disappears\\nafter birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear in\\nliver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.\\nThe AFP test is used to screen people at high risk for\\nthese conditions.

Contin-\\nued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is very important that the doctor know precisely\\nhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since the\\nAFP level considered normal changes over the length of\\nthe pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetus\\nlead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since an\\nAFP test is only a screening tool, more specific tests\\nmust follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormal\\ntest result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has a\\nbirth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results\\n(either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetus\\nthat has a serious condition.\\nDescription\\nThe AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of\\npregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on the\\ninside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam-\\nple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis.\\nTest results are usually available after about one week.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no specific physical preparation for the AFP\\ntest.\\nAftercare\\nThere is no specific aftercare involved with this\\nscreening test.\\nRisks\\nThe risks associated with drawing blood are mini-\\nmal, but may include bleeding from the puncture site,\\nfeeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn, or\\nblood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma).\\nNormal results\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per\\nmilliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability. The\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmniotic fluid —Fluid within the uterine sac in\\nwhich the fetus lives until born.\\nFetus—The stage in human development from the\\nsecond month of pregnancy until birth.\\nprobability (1:100, for example) translates into the\\nchance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100 chance,\\nfor example).\\nWhen testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP\\nresults are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An AFP\\nlevel less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered nor-\\nmal.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe doctor will inform the woman of her specific\\nincreased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan-\\ndard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater than\\nthe standard risk for women who are 35 years old or\\nolder (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended.\\nAgain, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormal\\nAFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that has\\nDown’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk;\\nappropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor-\\nmal screening result.\\nIn tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level\\ngreater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCunningham, Gary, et al.

This causes vasodilation and allows\\nblood to flow more easily.\\nPurpose\\nThese drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are\\nused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure\\n(hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia\\n(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterized\\nby an enlarged prostate gland.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and\\nthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the\\nblood vessels to the point of causing stroke, heart fail-\\nure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure\\nmay also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controlling\\nhigh blood pressure makes these problems less likely.\\nAlpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causing\\nvasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of the\\nblood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.\\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\\nThis condition particularly affects older men. Over\\ntime, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-\\nder, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere with\\nthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.\\nMen who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinate\\nmore often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-\\nly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-\\ntraction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-\\ncles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to\\nflow more freely.\\nDescription\\nCommonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-\\nsion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin\\n(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also used\\nin the treatment of heart failure. All are available only\\nwith a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the patient and\\nthe type of alpha blocker and may change over the course\\nof treatment. The prescribing physician will gradually\\nincrease the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may need\\nas much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per day\\nof doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,\\nbut most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosage\\nincreases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.\\nAlpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,\\neven if the medication does not seem to be working at\\nfirst. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improve\\nbecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.\\nPatients should avoid missing any doses, and should not\\ntake larger or more frequent doses to make up for\\nmissed doses.\\nPrecautions\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a\\ngreater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness ,\\nlightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting. Activ-\\nities such as driving, using machines, or doing anything\\nelse that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking the\\nfirst dose should be avoided. Patients should be reminded\\nto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in the\\nmiddle of the night. The same precautions are recom-\\nmended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has been\\nstopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety on\\nthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers should\\ninform his or her physician, so that the physician can\\ntake this factor into account when increasing dosage.\\nDizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-\\nly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drink\\nalcohol, exercise, stand for a long time, or are exposed to\\nhot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-\\ntions and alcohol consumption should be limited.\\nSome people may feel drowsy or less alert when\\nusing these drugs. They should accordingly avoid driving\\nor performing activities that require full attention.\\nPeople diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease\\nmay also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They should\\ninform their physicians about these conditions if alpha\\nblockers are prescribed. Older people may also be more\\nsensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted side\\neffects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness.\\nIt should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure\\nhigh blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi-\\ntion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrink\\nan enlarged prostate gland. Although they will help\\nrelieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, the\\nprostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may be\\nnecessary to have prostate surgery.\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood counts. Patients\\nmay need to have their blood checked regularly while\\ntaking this medicine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 129\\nAlpha1-adrenergic blockers\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 129'),\n",

Eventually, kidney dialysis or transplant\\nmay be necessary.\\nDescription\\nAlport syndrome affects about one in 5,000 Ameri-\\ncans, striking men more often and severely than women.\\nThere are several varieties of the syndrome, some occur-\\nring in childhood and others not causing symptoms until\\nmen reach their 20s or 30s. All varieties of the syndrome\\nare characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-\\ngresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the\\npresence of excessive amounts of urea and other waste\\nproducts in the blood).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect\\nin one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It is\\nusually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-\\ner. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-\\ntory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be a\\nspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.\\nBlood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of\\nAlport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear in\\nvarying combinations include:\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• sensorineural hearing loss\\n• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements\\n(nystagmus), cataracts, or cornea problems]\\n• skin problems\\n• platelet disorders\\n• abnormal white blood cells\\n• smooth muscle tumors\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlbumin—A protein that is important in maintain-\\ning blood volume. Low albumin levels is one sign\\nof Alport syndrome.\\nDialysis—A technique of removing waste material\\nfrom the blood. It is used with patients whose kid-\\nneys have stopped functioning and can no longer\\ncleanse the blood on their own.\\nDiuretic —A drug that increases the amount of\\nurine a person produces.\\nHematuria —Blood in the urine, Hematuria is a\\nhallmark of Alport syndrome.\\nPulmonary edema —Excess fluid in the air spaces\\nof the lungs.\\nUremia—The presence of excessive amounts of\\nurea and other waste products in the blood.\\nNot all patients with Alport syndrome have hearing\\nproblems. In general, those with normal hearing have\\nless severe cases of Alport syndrome.\\nDiagnosis\\nAlport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu-\\nation and family history, together with a kidney biopsy\\nthat can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condi-\\ntion. Urinalysis may reveal blood or protein in the urine.\\nBlood tests can reveal a low platelet level.\\nIn addition, tests for the Alport gene are now avail-\\nable. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered by\\nmany types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnose\\naffected children even before birth, and genetic linkage\\ntests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn-\\ndrome are also available.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alport\\nsyndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the problems\\nrelated to kidney failure, such as the presence of too\\nmany waste products in the blood (uremia).\\nTo control kidney inflammation (nephritis), patients\\nshould:\\n• restrict fluids\\n• control high blood pressure\\n• manage pulmonary edema\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 131\\nAlport syndrome\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 131'),\n",

High altitude is defined as\\nheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitude\\nis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet\\n(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined as\\nheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority\\nof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when\\nthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% of\\npeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one day\\nwill develop altitude sickness. Children under six years\\nand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles may\\nbe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medical\\nconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—may\\nbecome sick at more moderate altitudes.\\nDescription\\nThere are three major clinical syndromes that fall\\nunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain\\nsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema\\n(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).\\nThese syndromes are not separate, individual syndromes\\nas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resulting\\nfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,\\nand the other two represent severe, life-threatening forms\\nof altitude sickness.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2132\\nAltitude sickness\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132'),\n",

(Partial pressure is a\\nterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the term\\nconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,\\nat 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen\\ndrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, there\\nis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for the\\nindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-\\nmore, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygen\\nreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These two\\nconditions are the major factors that form the basis for all\\nthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.\\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). This\\nis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapid\\nrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxia\\nat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and it\\noccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is a\\nresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lower\\nto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who have\\nlived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayan\\nand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-\\nply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhaps\\nthrough a genetic ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of\\naltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes higher\\ngreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981\\nm) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia is\\nassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-\\nanism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-\\nfirmed. It is important to realize that some individuals\\nacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.\\nAs a result, under similar conditions some will suffer from\\nAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibility\\nof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-\\nnot be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from\\nAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the second\\nor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usually\\nabates after three to five days if they remain at the same\\naltitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel to\\nan even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a few\\nhours to a few days following ascent, and they include\\ndizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea, vomit-\\ning, loss of appetite, and insomnia.\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-\\nthreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage of\\nthose who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaks\\nfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lung\\ntissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lung\\ntissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins to\\nKEY TERMS\\nCerebral—Pertaining to the brain.\\nEdema—Accumulation of excess fluid in the tis-\\nsues of the body.\\nHypoxemia—Insufficient oxygenation of the blood.\\nHypoxia—A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\\nrequired for effective ventilation.\\nPulmonary—Pertaining to the lungs.\\nbecome more and more short of breath. HAPE is known\\nto afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their level\\nof physical fitness.\\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-\\nly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, a\\ncough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody\\nsputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-\\ntance is provided by this point, the patient goes into a\\ncoma and dies within a few hours.\\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and\\nmost severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebral\\nedema, and its mechanism of development is also poorly\\nunderstood. The symptoms often begin with those of\\nAMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered level\\nof consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,\\nloss of coordination, hallucinations , and even seizures.\\nIf no intervention is implemented, death is the result.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\\nfrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-\\ning travel to higher altitudes.\\nTreatment\\nMild AMS requires no treatment other than an\\naspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-\\nther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because they\\nmay blunt the respiratory response, making it even more\\ndifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidly\\nenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen in\\nthe environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviate\\nsymptoms of mild AMS.\\nAs for HAPE and HACE, the most important course\\nof action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-\\nble.

Should\\nmild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should be\\navoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual\\nshould return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicate\\nthat acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken before\\nascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-\\ntude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,\\nso climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-\\nduce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clear\\nurine).

AD usually occurs in old age, and\\nis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as\\nremembering, reasoning, and planning.\\nDescription\\nA person with AD usually has a gradual decline in\\nmental functions, often beginning with slight memory\\nloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain\\nemployment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to\\nreason and exercise judgment. Communication ability,\\nmood, and personality may also be affected. Most people\\nwho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,\\nalthough that interval may be as short as one year or as\\nlong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death\\nin adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD;\\nthat number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by\\nthe middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole\\nages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50s\\ndevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-\\nnantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all people\\nbetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75\\nand 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more\\nwomen than men are affected with AD, but this may be\\nbecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher\\nproportion of women in the most affected age groups.\\nThe costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-\\nerable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in\\n1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient with\\nmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and\\n$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual direct\\nand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the United\\nStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.\\nSlightly more than half of AD patients are cared for at\\nhome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety of\\nhealth care institutions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are\\nunknown. Some strong leads have been found through\\nrecent research, however, and these have also given some\\ntheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2134\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134'),\n",

As these neurons in the hippocampus\\nstop functioning, the short-term memory of the person\\nfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.\\nLater AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areas\\nresponsible for language and reasoning; this language\\nskills are lost and the ability to make judgments is\\nchanged. Personality changes occur, which may include\\nemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-\\nity of these changes increases with the progression of the\\ndisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain become\\ninvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink and\\nlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-\\nden, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\\nAutopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions\\nof the brain affected by the disease become clogged with\\ntwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles\\nand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted\\nmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. In\\nAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilize\\nparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twisted\\nand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.\\nAmyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-\\namyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein called\\namyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-\\nrons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spaces\\nbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clear\\nexactly how these structures cause problems, many\\nresearchers believe that their formation is responsible for\\nthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interfering\\nwith the normal communication between neurons in the\\nbrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of\\n2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms have\\nbeen approved by the United States Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level of\\nchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-\\nrotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-\\ntion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-\\ncholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks down\\nacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released by\\nneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. These\\ndrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’s\\nability to perform normal activities of daily living.\\nWhat triggers the formation of plaques and tangles\\nand the development of AD are unknown. AD likely\\nresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,\\nenvironmental, and others not yet identified. Two types\\nof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-\\nmal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, with\\nno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described in\\nterms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring in\\npeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those\\n65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 of\\nAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases\\nof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in some\\nfamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than the\\nmore common late-on-set type.\\nAll FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have\\nbeen identified so far are the early on-set type. As many\\nas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by three\\ngenes located on three different chromosomes. Some\\nfamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-\\nmosome 21, which causes the production of abnormal\\nAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-\\nsenilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes the\\nproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others\\nhave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-\\ned on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-\\nmal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymes\\nthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be important\\nin the synaptic connections between brain cells.\\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\\ncause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, but\\ngenetics does appear to play a role in this more common\\nform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-\\nsity in the early 1990s, potentially the most important\\ngenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene on\\nthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes\\nfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.\\nAPOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), called\\nAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inherits\\none APOE from each parent, and therefore can either\\nhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies of\\none. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect some\\npeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with a\\nlower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD does\\ndevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found in\\nthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-\\ntral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increase\\nthe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritance\\nof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to those\\nwithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about three\\ntimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those with\\ntwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-\\ning APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as much\\nas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk of\\ndeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyone\\nwith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it can\\nstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases the\\nchances of developing AD is not known with certainty.\\nHowever, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-\\namyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-\\nering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involve\\ninteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135'),\n",

In\\n2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genome\\nwere identified, where one out of several hundred genes\\nin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.\\nThese genes, which are not yet identified, appear to make\\na contribution to the risk of developing late-onset AD\\nthat is at least as important as APOE e4.\\nOther non-genetic factors have also been studied in\\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brain\\nmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to\\nreduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of blood\\nflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting for\\nthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases blood\\nflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactive\\nmolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells of\\nall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-\\nplies of protective antioxidants thought to protect against\\nfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,\\nand its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease are still unknown, there are several risk factors\\nthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-\\nease. The most significant one is, of course, age; older\\npeople develop AD at much higher rates than younger\\nones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may be\\nlinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinically\\ncontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterol\\nlevels may also be important. Scientists have shown that\\nhigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-\\ncally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate\\nof plaque deposition. There are also parallels between\\nAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders\\nthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-\\nson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.\\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations are\\nalso being conducted to learn more about whether and to\\nwhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, and\\nethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For\\nexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-\\ndence in childhood, along with fewer than six years of\\nschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-\\never, the low educational attainment that was identified as\\na risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-\\nterious socioeconomic or environmental influences in\\nchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpreting\\nepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of the\\nissues and the large number of variables involved.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected of\\ncontributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-\\nies have not borne out these links. Among these have\\nbeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-\\nmercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none\\nof these factors has been shown to cause AD or increase\\nits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links to\\nother environmental factors.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-\\nally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory\\nlapses are of course common to everyone, and do not by\\nthemselves signify any change in cognitive function. The\\nperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort of\\nmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—but\\nprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such as\\nforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becoming\\nlost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhood\\nbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A person\\nwith AD may forget the names of family members, or\\nforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence by\\nthe time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-\\ning inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,\\nand personality or behavior changes. Some patients have\\ntrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-\\ntion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-\\ndrome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the same\\nideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior known\\nas perseveration. In the final stages people may have\\nsevere problems with eating, communicating, and con-\\ntrolling their bladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten\\nwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-\\ntoms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:\\n• memory loss that affects job skills\\n• difficulty performing familiar tasks\\n• problems with language\\n• disorientation of time and place\\n• poor or decreased judgment\\n• problems with abstract thinking\\n• misplacing things\\n• changes in mood or behavior\\n• changes in personality\\n• loss of initiative\\nOther types of dementia, including some that are\\nreversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important for\\nthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-\\nfessional who can weigh the possibility that his or her\\nsymptoms may have another cause.

Modifications of the home to\\nincrease safety and security are often necessary. The\\ncaregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,\\nand burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becoming\\nfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-\\ning the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,\\ncan help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-\\ncult process of the disease. Regular medical care by a\\npractitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD is\\nimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratory\\ninfections can be diagnosed and treated properly, rather\\nthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable decline\\nseen in AD.\\nPeople with AD are also often depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition , and\\ngeneral poor health.

Patients tak-\\ning tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor their\\nALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,\\nvomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and\\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month in\\nearly 1998, with additional costs for the weekly blood\\nmonitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to be\\ncost-effective for those who respond to it, since it may\\ndecrease the number of months a patient needs nursing\\ncare. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treat\\nmild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps\\nsome patients for periods of time ranging from months to\\nabout two years. Donepezil has two advantages over\\ntacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given once\\ndaily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does not\\nappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does not\\nrequire weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominal\\nside effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-\\nmately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in April\\nof 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patients\\nto carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,\\ndecrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-\\ntation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,\\nmemory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of the\\nother two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stops\\nor reverses the progression of AD.\\nEstrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-\\nscribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo-\\nporosis. Several preliminary studies have shown that\\nwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and those\\nwho develop AD have a slower progression and less\\nsevere symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear to\\nhave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.\\nPreliminary studies have also suggested a reduced\\nrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly use\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-\\ning aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-\\nminophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-\\nacteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect of\\nthe disease is not yet known.\\nAntioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect\\nagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have\\nbeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-\\nsue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to see\\nwhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.\\nAnother antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to\\ndelay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due to\\nthe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to an\\nincrease in the overall health of those taking it.\\nDrugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and\\nsedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms\\n(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders )\\nof AD. Research is being conducted to search for better\\ntreatments, including non-drug approaches for AD\\npatients.\\nNursing care and safety\\nThe person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually\\nlose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use the\\ntoilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, he\\nmay be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-\\nson’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency to\\nwander may make it difficult to leave him unattended for\\neven a few minutes and make even the home a potentially\\ndangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibit\\ninappropriate sexual behaviors.\\nThe nursing care required for a person with AD is\\nwell within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-\\nficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant but\\nunpredictable nature of the demands put on them. In\\naddition, the personality changes undergone by a person\\nwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as a\\nloved one deteriorates, seeming to become a different\\nperson. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:\\nsome become quite gentle, and spend increasing amounts\\nof time in dreamlike states.\\nA loss of good grooming may be one of the early\\nsymptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,\\nand decreased interest in personal hygiene become more\\ncommon. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find these\\nchanges socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with.\\nThe caregiver will usually need to spend increasing\\namounts of time for grooming to compensate for the loss\\nof attention from the patient, although some adjustment\\nof expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is often\\nneeded as the disease progresses.\\nProper nutrition is important for a person with AD,\\nand may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure the\\nperson is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move-\\nment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube may\\nbe placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. A\\nfeeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easy\\nto care for if the patient is not resistant to its use.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2138\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 138'),\n",

In\\nall cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longer\\nbe allowed to drive, because of the increased potential\\nfor accidents and the increased likelihood of wandering\\nvery far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim-\\nple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed rails\\non the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great-\\nly increase safety. Electrical appliances should be\\nunplugged and put away when not in use, and matches,\\nlighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely out\\nof reach. The hot water heater temperature may be set\\nlower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergency\\nnumbers, including the poison control center and the\\nhospital emergency room, should be posted by the\\nphone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri-\\nodically reevaluate the physical safety of the home and\\nintroduce new strategies for continued safety.\\nCare for the caregiver\\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\\nAD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, which\\nbecomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementia\\ncaregivers spend significantly more time on caregiving\\nthan do people providing care for those with other types\\nof illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greater\\nimpact in terms of employment complications, caregiver\\nstrain, mental and physical health problems, time for\\nleisure and other family members, and family conflict\\nthan do other types of caregiving. It is common for AD\\ncaregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,\\nand hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for\\ntheir loved one and for themselves. Depression is an\\nextremely common consequence of being a full-time\\ncaregiver for a person with AD.

Medical treatment for depression\\nmay be an important adjunct to group support.\\nOutside help, nursing homes, and governmental\\nassistance\\nMost families eventually need outside help to relieve\\nsome of the burden of around-the-clock care for a person\\nwith AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer or\\npaid, may be available through local social service agen-\\ncies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasingly\\ncommon. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respite\\ncare may be available as well.\\nProviding the total care required by a person with\\nlate-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for a\\nfamily, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami-\\nlies consider nursing home care. This decision is often one\\nof the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen as\\nan abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami-\\nly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler-\\ngy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of this\\ntransition.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning\\nthat when a decrease in vision is detected, other causes\\nmust be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-\\nopia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two lines\\nor more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) between\\nthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worse\\nwould be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someone\\nhas 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 with\\nthe left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision with\\ncorrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.\\nDescription\\nLazy eye is a common non-medical term used to\\ndescribe amblyopia because the eye with poorer vision\\ndoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia is\\nthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,\\naffecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%\\nof the population. Vision is a combination of the clarity\\nof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-\\ning of those images by the brain. If the images produced\\nby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain may\\nnot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-\\nferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-\\npresses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead to\\namblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferring\\none eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-\\nment in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:\\n• Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is\\nthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. The\\ntwo eyes are looking in two different directions at the\\nsame time. The brain is sent two different images and\\nthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or\\n“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional\\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-\\ntive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-\\nference of prescriptions between the two eyes). For\\nexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than the\\nother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the other\\neye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the two\\ndissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrier\\nimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the\\nimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain\\n“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataract\\nmay become amblyopic.\\n• Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light\\ncannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, the\\neye is essentially not being used. This can lead to\\namblyopia.\\n• Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-\\ntional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result in\\namblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the B\\nvitamins may result in toxic amblyopia.\\n• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.\\nBarring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-\\ndren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Children\\nmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor the\\neye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing or\\nreaching for things when approached from the side of the\\namblyopic eye.

If an infant’s\\ngood eye is covered, the child may cry.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause children with outwardly normal eyes may\\nhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision\\nscreenings performed for all children. While there is\\nsome controversy regarding the age children should have\\ntheir first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,\\nbe examined at any age, even at one day of life.\\nSome recommend that children have their vision\\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-\\nmologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.\\nOthers recommend testing by at least the child’s fourth\\nbirthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-\\nment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable after\\nage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the better\\nthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part of\\na child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eye\\nproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.\\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to\\nmeasure the refractive status of the eyes. This can help\\ndetermine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-held\\ninstrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or\\ninfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-\\ntion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined\\nusing a variety of methods. Many different eye charts are\\navailable (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters).

Color vision testing may also\\nbe performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly-\\nopia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening\\nproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami-\\nnation of the eyes and visual system is very important\\nwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion\\ntherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye\\n(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopic\\neye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too may\\nbecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment plan\\nshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understand\\nhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-\\nes may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focus\\nand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training\\n(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in the\\nweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-\\nod of years to maintain the improvement.\\nWhile patching is necessary to get the amblyopic\\neye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason\\nfor the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there are\\nerrors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may be\\nnecessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition is\\nindicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,\\namblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the good\\neye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use the\\namblyopic eye.\\nPrognosis\\nThe younger the person, the better the chance for\\nimprovement with occlusion and vision therapy.

Success in the treatment of amblyopia also\\ndepends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specific\\ntype of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-\\ntant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-\\nnificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The best\\noutcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.\\nPrevention\\nTo protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware\\nof amblyopia as a potential problem.

Persons with amebiasis may experi-\\nence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea ,\\nfever, and cramps. The disease may also affect the\\nintestines, liver, or other parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nAmebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one\\nof the most common parasitic diseases occurring in\\nhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each\\nyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical\\nareas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-\\nquate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occur\\nin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit any\\nsymptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 people\\ndie of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between\\n1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-\\nsis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrant\\nworkers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrants\\ndevelop amebiasis at a higher rate.\\nHuman beings are the only known host of the amebi-\\nasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of age\\nor sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarily\\nspread in food and water that has been contaminated by\\nhuman feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-\\ntact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-\\nal outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces are\\nused as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-\\nplies contaminated with human feces.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRecently, it has been discovered that persons with\\nsymptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe-\\nba histolytica , and those individuals who exhibit no\\nsymptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-\\nlooking ameba called Entamoeba dispar . During their\\nlife cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:\\nthe infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move\\nbut can survive outside the human body because of its\\nprotective covering, and the disease-producing form, the\\ntrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot\\nsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot\\ninfect others. The disease is most commonly transmitted\\nwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E.\\nhistolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract\\nthe cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls\\nof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,\\nreleasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released within\\nthe intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on\\nintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large\\nintestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, the\\ntrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal\\ntissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).\\nThe trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in the\\nintestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal wall\\nand be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or\\nother organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestines\\neventually form new cysts that are carried through the\\ndigestive tract and excreted in the feces.

Most persons with\\namebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though\\nthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable of\\ninfecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-\\nminating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,\\nfor example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.\\nCHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu-\\nals may experience symptoms over a long period of time\\nduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experience\\nrecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to four\\nweeks and recur over a period of years. These patients\\nmay also suffer from abdominal cramps, fatigue , and\\nweight loss.\\nAMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal\\namebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-\\ntine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severe\\nabdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as\\n104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-\\nbic dysentery may cause complications, including\\ninflammation of the appendix ( appendicitis ), a tear in\\nthe intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severe\\ninflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).\\nAMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the\\nbowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can\\nresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acute\\namebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptoms\\nthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.\\nPERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may pro-\\nduce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus\\n(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”\\nappearance and are painful to the touch.\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-\\nly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes all\\nforms of the disease that affect other organs.\\nThe most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis\\nis amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States, ame-\\nbic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-\\npanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result from\\ndirect infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as a com-\\nplication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebic\\nabscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or\\nabdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right side\\ndirectly above the liver.\\nOther forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though\\nrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,\\nor genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-\\ntively high mortality rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly\\nbecause the disease can affect several areas of the body\\nand can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms to\\nbeing severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, a\\nphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when a\\npatient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,\\ndiarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure to\\namebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,\\nor anal intercourse.\\nIt is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and\\nanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that\\nproduces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-\\nrectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage the\\ngrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because of\\nthe serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential cases\\nof IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samples\\nand blood tests, and a procedure involving a visual\\ninspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu-\\nlar instrument (sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.\\nA diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one\\nor more tests, depending on the location of the disease.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a stool\\nsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E.\\nhistolytica and not one of the many other intestinal ame-\\nbas that are often found but that do not cause disease. A\\nseries of three stool tests is approximately 90% accurate\\nin confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu-\\nnately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosing\\namebomas or extraintestinal infections.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nSigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in\\nwhich a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig-\\nmoidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part of\\nthe large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue or\\nfluid samples from the intestinal lining.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2144\\nAmebiasis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 144'),\n",

Blood serum will usually test positive for antibody\\nwithin a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however,\\ncannot always distinguish between a current or past infec-\\ntion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood for\\nas long as 10 years following initial infection.\\nImaging studies\\nA number of sophisticated imaging techniques, such\\nas computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be used to\\ndetermine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat-\\ned, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw a\\nsample of tissue to determine whether the abscess is\\nindeed caused by an amebic infection.\\nTreatment\\nAsymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may\\nrequire no treatment. However, because of the potential\\nfor disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with a\\nmedication to kill the disease-causing amebas. More\\nsevere cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treated\\nby replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame-\\nbic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bed\\nrest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat-\\nment can be complicated because different drugs may be\\nrequired to eliminate the parasite, based on the location\\nof the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame-\\nbiasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories:\\nLuminal amebicides\\nThese drugs get their name because they act on\\norganisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel.\\nThey include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida-\\nzole, and paromomycin.\\nTissue amebicides\\nTissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the\\nliver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy-\\ndroemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Because\\nthese drugs have potentially serious side effects, patients\\ngiven emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest and\\nheart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be the\\nmost useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess.\\nPatients taking metronidazole must avoid alcohol\\nbecause the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea,\\nvomiting, and headache.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmeboma—A mass of tissue that can develop on\\nthe wall of the colon in response to amebic infec-\\ntion.\\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreign\\nprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nAppendicitis —Condition characterized by the\\nrapid inflammation of the appendix, a part of the\\nintestine.\\nAsymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and\\nare usually capable of transmitting the disease but\\nwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are\\nsaid to be asymptomatic.\\nDysentery —Intestinal infection marked by diar-\\nrhea containing blood and mucus.\\nFulminating colitis—A potentially fatal complica-\\ntion of amebic dysentery marked by sudden and\\nsevere inflammation of the intestinal lining, severe\\nbleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive shedding\\nof dead tissue.\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) —Disease in\\nwhich the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.\\nLumen—The inner cavity or canal of a tube-\\nshaped organ, such as the bowel.\\nProtozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic\\norganism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, differ-\\nent from bacteria (prokaryotic).\\nMost patients are given a combination of luminal and\\ntissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven to ten\\ndays.

Frey\\nAmebic dysentery see Amebiasis\\nAmenorrhea\\nDefinition\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is called amenor-\\nrhea. Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having a\\nperiod by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is more\\ncommon and refers to either the temporary or permanent\\nending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-\\nmally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-\\nly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or more\\nperiods in a row.\\nDescription\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not\\na disease. While the average age that menstruation begins\\nis 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-\\nrhea in the United States is just 2.5%.\\nSome female athletes who participate in rowing,\\nlong distance running, and cycling, may notice a few\\nmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for\\ndeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,\\nwho typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-\\nrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-\\natric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition, excessive\\nthinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content too\\nlow, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physical\\ntraining prior to puberty can delay menarche (the onset\\nof menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-\\nche for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-\\ndepressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induce\\namenorrhea.\\nPrimary amenorrhea\\nHowever, the main cause is a delay in the beginning\\nof puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity or\\npoor nutrition) or because of a problem in the endocrine\\nsystem, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism. An\\nobstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus may\\nbe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,\\nendocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.\\nTypical causes of primary amenorrhea include:\\n• excessive physical activity\\n• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or\\nbulimia)\\n• extreme obesity\\n• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)\\n• chronic illness\\n• turner’s syndrome.

In adolescents, pregnancy and\\nstress are two major causes. Missed periods are usually\\ncaused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-\\nment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-\\nods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, or\\nincreased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-\\nsation of periods for four months should be evaluated.\\nThe most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is\\npregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarily\\nafter she stops taking birth control pills. This temporary\\nhalt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in some\\ncases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-\\nrhea may also be related to hormonal problems related to\\nstress, depression, anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may\\nbe caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as a\\ntumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-\\nnently after menopause or a hysterectomy.\\nPolycystic ovary syndromeis another common cause\\nof secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-\\ning many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels of\\nmale hormones (androgens). This condition is related to\\nimproper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releases\\nhormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-\\nmones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-\\ntics, such as acne and coarse body hair. If the condition is\\nnot treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,\\nand chronically high levels of estrogen may increase the\\nchance of developing cancer of the uterine lining.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,\\nbut the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-\\ncy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period is\\ntwo to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogen\\ndeficiency, or other problems with the endocrine system\\nneed to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-\\nroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.\\nThe diagnosis usually includes a patient history and\\na physical exam (including a pelvic exam ). If a woman\\nhas missed three or more periods in a row, a physician\\nmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,\\na scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitary\\ntumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis to\\nrule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-\\nmary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’s\\nalways important to discover the cause of the problem in\\nany case. Not all conditions can be treated, but any\\nunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated.\\nIf a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-\\nterone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-\\nrect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birth\\ncontrol pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor is\\ntreated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certain\\nhormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bring\\non a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessive\\nexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods in\\nteen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed\\nfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts.\\nPrognosis\\nProlonged amenorrhea can lead to infertilityand other\\nmedical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning of the\\nbones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stress\\nor illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-\\nes or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-\\ncontinuing birth control pills usually go away within six to\\neight weeks, although it may take up to a year.\\nThe prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends\\non the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.\\nSpironolactone, a drug that blocks the production of\\nmale hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If a\\nwoman wishes to become pregnant, treatment with\\nclomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,\\nsurgery on the ovaries.\\nPrevention\\nPrimary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-\\ntion cannot be prevented. In general, however, women\\nshould maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,\\nrest, and not too much stress, avoiding smoking and sub-\\nstance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal-\\nanced diet and rest and exercise normally.

Of these 20 amino acids, ten are not made by\\nthe body and must be acquired through diet. Congenital\\n(present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect amino\\nacid metabolism or congenital abnormalities in the\\namino acid transport system of the kidneys creates a con-\\ndition called aminoaciduria.\\nScreening is especially important in newborns.\\nSome congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause\\nmental retardation that can prevented with prompt\\ntreatment of the newborn. One of the best known exam-\\nples of this is phenylketonuria (PKU). This is an genetic\\nerror in metabolism of phenylalanine, an amino acid\\nfound in milk. Individuals with PKU do not produce the\\nenzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine.\\nPKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births in\\nthe United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians and\\nless prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans.\\nNewborns in the United States are routinely screened for\\nPKU by a blood test.\\nThere are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary or\\noverflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in the\\nenzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids. Overflow\\naminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test.\\nSecondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because of\\na congenital defect in the amino acid transport system in\\nthe tubules of the kidneys. This produces increased\\namino acids in the urine. Blood and urine test in combi-\\nnation are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is of\\nthe overflow or renal type. Urine tests are also used to\\nmonitor specific amino acid disorders.\\nNewborns are screened for amino acid disorders.\\nYoung children with acidosis (accumulation of acid in\\nthe body), severe vomiting and diarrhea , or urine with\\nan abnormal color or odor, are also screened with a urine\\ntest for specific amino acid levels.\\nPrecautions\\nBoth blood and urine tests are simple tests that can\\nbe done in a doctor’s office or clinic.

Gram-nega-\\ntive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-\\nfully be combated with aminoglycosides include\\nPseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter species,\\namong others. Aminoglycosides are also effective against\\nmycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis.\\nThe aminoglycosides can be used against certain\\nGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employed\\nbecause other antibiotics are more effective and have\\nfewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffective\\nagainst anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow in\\nthe presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And only\\none aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-\\nsitic infection.\\nLike all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not\\neffective against influenza , the common cold , or other\\nviral infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-\\nease, eighth cranial nerve disease,myasthenia gravis, and\\nParkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to taking\\nany aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advised\\nagainst taking aminoglycosides, because their infants may\\nsuffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-\\nance. However, those factors need to be considered along-\\nside the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases of\\nserious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breast\\nmilk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-\\nscribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.\\nDescription\\nStreptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated\\nfrom Streptomyces griseusin the mid-1940s. This antibiot-\\nic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main\\ndrawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cells\\nin the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,\\nsome strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment with\\nstreptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-\\nsiderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-\\ntomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.\\nAminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the\\ngastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-\\nly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished in\\nquantity. The route of drug administration depends on the\\ntype and location of the infection being treated. The typi-\\ncal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-\\ntion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection into\\na vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.\\nIf the infection being treated involves the central nervous\\nsystem, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.\\nThe bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not\\nbeen fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches to\\na bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-\\nnels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,\\nthe aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.\\nRibosomes are the intracellular structures responsible for\\nmanufacturing proteins. This attachment either shuts\\ndown protein production or causes the cell to produce\\nabnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannot\\nsurvive with this impediment.\\nAntibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may\\npair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually a\\nbeta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.\\nBeta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cell\\nwall, making it more porous. The increased porosity\\nallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.\\nTraditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at\\neven doses given throughout the day. It was thought that\\na steady plasma concentration was necessary to combat\\ninfection. However, this administration schedule is time\\nand labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a single\\ndaily dose can be as effective, or more effective, than\\nseveral doses throughout the day.\\nDosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,\\nand general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-\\nneys, it is important to assess any underlying problems\\nwith kidney function. Kidney function is assessed by\\nmeasuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-\\nmally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is an\\nindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at an\\noptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.\\nRisks\\nAminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-\\ntain cells in the ears and in the kidneys.

They may even be aware\\nthat they suffer from a memory disorder.\\nPeople who experience amnesia have been instrumen-\\ntal in helping brain researchers determine how the brain\\nprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s, researchers\\nviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-\\nences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioning\\nwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-\\ncific area of the brain.\\nIf all memory were stored in the same way, it would\\nbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brain\\narea would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-\\nies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such research\\ndemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-\\ncessing, storing, and drawing on memory.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable\\nto brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-\\ntion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to\\nthe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoff\\nsyndrome, for example, damage to the memory centers\\nof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-\\ntion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including\\nencephalitis and herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the\\namnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it is\\ntermed psychogenic.\\nThere are at least three general types of amnesia:\\n• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-\\nma and is characterized by the inability to remember\\nnew information. Recent experiences and short-term\\nmemory disappear, but victims can recall events prior\\nto the trauma with clarity.\\n• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the\\nopposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recall\\nevents that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-\\nber previously familiar information or the events pre-\\nceding the trauma.\\n• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no\\nconsistently identifiable cause, but researchers have\\nsuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacks\\nmay be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack ,\\nsometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when a\\nblockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-\\nply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences sudden\\nconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as\\n30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severe\\nattacks, a person is completely disoriented and may\\nexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-\\nal years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-\\nsient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-\\nsis for recovery.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at\\nseveral factors. During a physical examination, the doc-\\ntor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug and\\nmedication history, and checks the patient’s general\\nhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-\\nmine the extent of amnesia and the memory system\\naffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such as\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal whether\\nthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude\\ntreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and\\nis handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause,\\ncognitive rehabilitation may be helpful in learning\\nstrategies to cope with memory impairment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2152\\nAmnesia\\nAmygdalaHippocampus\\nMemory loss may result from bilateral damage to the limbic\\nsystem of the brain responsible for memory storage, pro-\\ncessing, and recall.(Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group).\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 152'),\n",

By 1997, approximately\\n800 different diagnostic tests were available, most of\\nthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs\\ndisease, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dys-\\ntrophy and cystic fibrosis.\\nAmniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended\\nfor women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. It\\nis also recommended for women who have already borne\\nchildren with birth defects, or when either of the parents\\nhas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-\\ntic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is to\\nconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other\\ndefects which may have shown up previously during rou-\\ntine maternal blood screening.\\nThe risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary\\ngenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-\\ned to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greater\\nthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to begin\\namnio testing because that is the age at which the risk of\\ncarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals the\\nrisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about\\none in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a child\\nwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45\\nit increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-\\nnant women over 35 in the United States undergo\\namniocentesis and many younger women also decide to\\nhave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Down\\nsyndrome infants born in the United States each year are\\nto women younger than 35.\\nOne of the most common reasons for performing\\namniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)\\ntest. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus\\nand present in the mother’s blood. A simple blood\\nscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week of\\npregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’s\\nblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signal\\npossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-\\npositive rate, another test such as amnio is recommended\\nwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.\\nAmniocentesis is generally performed during the\\n16th week of pregnancy, with results usually available\\nwithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio as\\nearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-\\ned because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-\\ncarriage when done at this time. The advantage of early\\namnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-\\nsion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatment\\nof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the fact\\nthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the\\nearlier they are performed.\\nPrecautions\\nAs an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,\\nalthough small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents must\\nweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, or\\nindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small risk\\nof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. The\\nserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse test\\nresults can bring must also be considered. The decision to\\nundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.\\nDescription\\nThe word amniocentesis literally means “puncture\\nof the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a\\ndeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. During\\nthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a very\\nfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterus\\nand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately one\\nounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-\\nless procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-\\ntimes using local anesthesia.\\nThe physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-\\ndle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-\\ning the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-\\ndle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the woman\\ncan return home after a brief observation period. She\\nmay be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and to\\navoid heavy lifting for two days.\\nThe sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory\\nwhere fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated and\\ngrown in order to provide enough genetic material for\\ntesting. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material is\\nthen extracted and treated so that visual examination for\\ndefects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,\\nthe simple presence of a telltale chemical compound in\\nthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.\\nDepending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill of\\nthe lab conducting them, all the results are available\\nbetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken.\\nCost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,\\nand the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage for\\nwomen over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternal\\nblood screening results, and when genetic disorders run\\nin the family.\\nAn alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori-\\nonic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be performed as\\nearly as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allows\\nfor the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant-\\ned, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2154\\nAmniocentesis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 154'),\n",

It is performed to remove diseased tis-\\nsue or relieve pain.\\nPurpose\\nArms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can all be\\namputated. Most amputations involve small body parts\\nsuch as a finger, rather than an entire limb. About 65,000\\namputations are performed in the United States each year.\\nAmputation is performed for the following reasons:\\n• to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate blood\\nsupply\\n• to remove malignant tumors\\n• because of severe trauma to the body part\\nThe blood supply to an extremity can be cut off\\nbecause of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of the\\narteries, arterial embolism , impaired circulation as a\\ncomplication of diabetes mellitus, repeated severe infec-\\ntion that leads to gangrene, severe frostbite, Raynaud’s\\ndisease, or Buerger’s disease.\\nMore than 90% of amputations performed in the\\nUnited States are due to circulatory complications of dia-\\nbetes.

Patients with blood clotting disorders are also not\\ngood candidates for amputation.\\nDescription\\nAmputations can be either planned or emergency\\nprocedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the main\\nreasons for emergency amputations. The operation is\\nperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-\\neral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.\\nDetails of the operation vary slightly depending on\\nwhat part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations is\\ntwofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound will\\nheal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow the\\nattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.\\nThe surgeon makes an incision around the part to be\\namputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.\\nA flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, and\\nskin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closed\\nover the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remain\\nin place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing or\\ncast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an amputation is performed, extensive testing\\nis done to determine the proper level of amputation. The\\ngoal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing is\\nmost likely to be complete, while allowing the maximum\\namount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation.\\nThe greater the blood flow through an area, the more\\nlikely healing is to occur. These tests are designed to mea-\\nsure blood flow through the limb. Several or all of them\\ncan be done to help choose the proper level of amputation.\\n• measurement of blood pressure in different parts of the\\nlimb\\n• xenon 133 studies, which use a radiopharmaceutical to\\nmeasure blood flow\\n• oxygen tension measurements in which an oxygen elec-\\ntrode is used to measure oxygen pressure under the skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2158\\nAmputation\\nFigure DFigure B\\nFigure A\\nFemur\\nSkin flapExposed\\nmuscle\\nFigure C\\nSciatic\\nnerve\\nAmputation of leg.

The stump is moved often to encourage good\\ncirculation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are started\\nas soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies have\\nshown that there is a positive relationship between early\\nrehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump and\\nprosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the\\nseverity of the amputation and the general health of the\\namputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks.\\nRehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially\\nfor above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera-\\npy is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel-\\ning is an important part of rehabilitation.

They\\nmay even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Many\\namputees benefit from joining self-help groups and\\nmeeting others who are also living with amputation.\\nAddressing the emotional aspects of amputation often\\nspeeds the physical rehabilitation process.\\nRisks\\nAmputation is major surgery. All the risks associated\\nwith the administration of anesthesia exist, along with\\nthe possibility of heavy blood loss and the development\\nof blood clots. Infection is of special concern to\\namputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. If\\nthe stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove the\\nprosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at a\\nhigher level.\\nFailure of the stump to heal is another major compli-\\ncation.

Centers that specialize in ampu-\\ntation usually have the lowest rates of complication.\\nPersistent pain in the stump or pain in the phantom\\nlimb is experienced by most amputees to some degree.\\nTreatment of phantom limb pain is difficult.

Enzymes are sub-\\nstances made and used by the body to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions. The primary function of the enzyme\\namylase is to break down starches in food so that they\\ncan be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually done\\nto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain.\\nPurpose\\nAmylase testing is performed to diagnose a number\\nof diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for\\nexample, is the most common reason for a high amylase\\nlevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapes\\nfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hours\\nafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start to\\nrise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-\\nally returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase. An\\nulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes into\\nthe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.\\nDuring a mumps infection, amylase from the inflamed\\nsalivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in the\\nliver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation of\\nthese tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,\\ntumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning, ruptured\\naortic aneurysm, and intestinal strangulation or perfora-\\ntion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-\\nease.\\nDescription\\nAmylase testing is done on both blood and urine.\\nThe laboratory may use any of several testing methods\\nthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-\\nstance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-\\ning the end-product or the reaction time, technicians can\\ncalculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.\\nMore sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-\\nlase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by the\\nsalivary glands.\\nUrine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-\\nlase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylase\\nfrom the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10\\nhours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine is\\nusually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.\\nResults are usually available the same day.\\nPreparation\\nIn most cases, no special preparation is necessary for\\na person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients taking\\nlonger term urine amylase tests will be given a container\\nand instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urine\\nshould be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site\\nor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-\\nture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-\\ning warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nEight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will\\nhave high amylase levels, up to four times the normal\\nlevel. Other causes of increased amylase, such as\\nmumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in the\\nabdomen but outside the uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ),\\ncertain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complications\\nof diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer, are further\\ninvestigated based on the person’s symptoms, medical\\nhistory, and the results of other tests.\\nIn kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at\\nremoving amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in the\\nblood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.\\nPeople with macroamylasia have large clumps of\\namylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to\\nmove through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-\\nlase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urine\\nwill be low.\\nAmylase levels may be low in severe liver disease\\n(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas\\nfails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions\\n(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build up\\nin the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), following\\nburns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic\\nfibrosis.

Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu-\\nmulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function,\\ncan cause organ failure or death. It is a rare disease,\\noccurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. It\\naffects males and females equally and usually develops\\nafter the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis have\\nbeen identified. Each one is associated with deposits of a\\ndifferent kind of protein.\\nTypes of amyloidosis\\nThe major forms of this disease are primary sys-\\ntemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis.\\nThere is also another form of amyloidosis associated\\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.\\nPrimary systemic amyloidosis usually develops\\nbetween the ages of 50 and 60.

Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it\\nmay also occur in association with multiple myeloma\\n(bone marrow cancer).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-\\ntion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:\\n• familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection\\ncharacterized by chills, weakness, headache , and\\nrecurring fever)\\n• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-\\ntine)\\n• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)\\n• leprosy\\n• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone\\nmarrow)\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-\\nited form of the disease. It occurs in members of most\\nethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive pattern\\nof symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-\\ndosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which means\\nthat only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to\\ncause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-\\nloidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.\\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the\\nbody. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and\\nnervous system are affected most often. Other common\\nsites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints,\\nliver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of amyloidosis is unknown.

It is also known as\\nmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the\\nbaseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper\\nmotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral\\nnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-\\nment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,\\nleading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-\\nly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-\\ntary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,\\nsuch as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of\\nitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, the\\nheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-\\ntem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people with\\nALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-\\ner, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss of\\nintellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.\\n“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a\\ncardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of the\\nregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”\\ndescribes the hardened tissue that develops in place of\\nhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 people\\nin the United States, with about 5,000 new cases each\\nyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,\\nalthough younger onset is possible. Men are slightly\\nmore likely to develop ALS than women.\\nALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal\\nwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, and\\nwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with\\nALS live beyond eight years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of\\nmotor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, these\\nneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the\\nmuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,\\nneck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles they\\nenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weakness\\nresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to muscle\\nwasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motor\\nneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, and\\nabnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neurons\\ncauses muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).\\nAlthough many causes of motor neuron degenera-\\ntion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet been\\nproven responsible. Results of recent research have\\nimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-\\ncals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of events\\nleads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-\\nrons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should be\\nproduced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether this\\nexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerative\\nprocesses.

Leg weakness\\nmay first become apparent by an increased frequency of\\nstumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-\\nculty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-\\nty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss of\\ndexterity in the fingers.\\nLess often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in\\nthe bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and\\nthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. A\\nperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tired\\nafter speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.\\nIn addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of\\nALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-\\nulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomes\\nobvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people without\\nthe disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.\\nWhile initial weakness may be limited to one region,\\nALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtually\\nall the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-\\ntoms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms and\\nhands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold the\\nhead up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makes\\nbreathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-\\ntrol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-\\nration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-\\ntion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilator\\nand scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS may\\nlive much longer than the average, although weakness and\\nwasting will continue to erode any remaining functional\\nabilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain function\\nof the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowing\\nsome communication to take place with simple blinks or\\nthrough use of a computer-assisted device.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-\\nical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-\\nination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-\\nness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-\\ntromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-\\nnostic process. Various other tests, including blood and\\nurine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule out\\nother possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors of\\nthe skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-\\nease, spinal arthritis, lead poisoning , or severe vitamin\\ndeficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care-\\nful review of all these factors.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that can\\nsignificantly alter its course.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nAnaerobic infections\\nDefinition\\nAn anaerobic infection is an infection caused by\\nbacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the\\npresence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deep\\nwounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where there is\\nlittle oxygen. These infections are characterized by\\nabscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue\\ndestruction.\\nDescription\\nAnaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-\\nteria grow in places which completely, or almost com-\\npletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in the\\nmouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.\\nCommonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria\\ninclude gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Nearly all\\ndental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a\\nnormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)\\nis damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,\\nthe immune system kills any invading bacteria, but\\nsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an\\ninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction\\n(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen\\nand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low\\noxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,\\nshock, injury, and surgery.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically\\nanywhere in the body. For example:\\n• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root\\ncanals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,\\nand ears.\\n• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia , lung\\nabscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung ( empye-\\nma), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis).\\n• Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the\\nabdomen include abscess formation, peritonitis , and\\nappendicitis.\\n• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\npelvic abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease ,\\ninflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), and\\npelvic infections following abortion, childbirth , and\\nsurgery.\\n• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common\\ncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructive\\ninfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-\\ntis), and bite wound infections.\\n• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\nbrain and spinal cord abscesses.\\n• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the\\nbloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-\\nteremia).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeople who have experienced shock, injury, or\\nsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumors\\nare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-\\nria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteria\\nwhich can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobic\\ninfections are “mixed infections” which means that\\nthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing. The\\nanaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infections\\nare Bacteroides fragilis , Peptostreptococcus , and\\nClostridium species.\\nThe signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection\\ncan vary depending on the location of the infection.

Symptoms for specific infections are\\nas follows:\\n• Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding\\ngums, bad breath , and pain. Severe infections may\\nproduce oozing sores.\\n• Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad breath,\\na bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense of choking.\\n• Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breath-\\ning, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.\\n• Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-\\nlowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.\\n• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining\\nfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,\\nand chills.\\n• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,\\npainful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.\\nSkin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,\\nand possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drains\\nfoul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may cause\\nextensive tissue destruction (necrosis).\\n• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever\\n(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, and\\nis potentially fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-\\nmarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, and\\nlocation of the infection. A foul-smelling infection or\\ndrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic\\ninfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-\\nteria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late in\\nthe infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection include\\ntissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. A\\nsample from the infected site may be obtained, using a\\nswab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-\\nria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteria\\ncan be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in the\\nlaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAbscess—A lump filled with pus resulting from an\\ninfection.\\nAnaerobic—Living and growing in the absence of\\noxygen.\\nNecrosis—Tissue death and destruction resulting\\nfrom infection or disease.\\nThe recent medical history of the patient is helpful\\nin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or\\nrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel\\ndisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The\\nfailure to improve following treatment with antibiotics\\nthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that the\\ninfection is caused by anaerobes. The location and type\\nof infection also help in the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if\\nbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at\\ninternal infections.\\nTreatment\\nSerious infections may require hospitalization for\\ntreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic\\ninfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify\\nthe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-\\notic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work\\nagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes are\\nkilled by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-\\nzole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).\\nOther antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin\\n(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).\\nSurgical removal or drainage of the abscess is\\nalmost always required. This may involve drainage by\\nneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess\\n(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior to\\nthe aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscesses\\ncan be drained using this procedure with the help of\\nultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualize\\ninternal organs). This type of abscess drainage may be\\nperformed in the doctor’s office.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery should be achieved with the\\nappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreated\\nor uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue and\\nbone destruction, which would require plastic surgery to\\nrepair. Serious infections can be life threatening.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough anaerobic infections can occur in anyone,\\ngood hygiene and general health may help to prevent\\ninfections.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

In boys\\nwith high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula)\\nconnecting the large intestine to either the urethra (which\\ndelivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. In\\ngirls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixty\\npercent of children with high anal atresia have other\\ndefects, including problems with the esophagus, urinary\\ntract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel may\\nopen in front of the circular mass of muscles that con-\\nstrict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, in\\nboys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine ends\\njust under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali-\\nties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every\\n5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.\\nA mother who has one child with these kind of condi-\\ntions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-\\nfers from this ailment.\\nCause and symptoms\\nAnal atresia is a defect in the development of the\\nfetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play a\\nminor role.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsually a physician can make an obvious visual\\ndiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,\\nhowever, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and\\nsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the\\nfirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-\\niting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-\\nsia and the exact position, x rays will be taken which\\ninclude injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\\nscans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-\\nniques used to determine the type and size of the anal\\natresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass x\\nrays through the body at different angles, and an MRI\\nuses a magnetic field and radio waves.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnus—The canal at the end of the large intestine\\nthrough which waste is excreted to the outside of\\nthe body.\\nBowel obstruction—Anything that prevents waste\\nfrom moving normally to the anal opening.\\nColostomy —An operation where the large intes-\\ntine is diverted through an opening in the\\nabdomen and waste is excreted.\\nFeces—Bodily waste material that normally passes\\nthrough the anus.\\nFistula—An abnormal channel that connects two\\norgans or connects an organ to the skin.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For\\nhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,\\na surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make a\\ntemporary opening ( colostomy ) in the abdomen where\\nwaste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine is\\nmoved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part of\\nthe anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy is\\nclosed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-\\nly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open the\\narea where the anus should be. If the channel is in the\\nwrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-\\ntion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,\\nthe pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate or\\nwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do this\\ndaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.\\nPrognosis\\nWith high anal atresia, many children have problems\\ncontrolling bowel function. Most also become constipat-\\ned.

The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long end\\nportion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solid\\nwastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestine\\ninclude the colon and the rectum.\\nDescription\\nDifferent cancers can develop in different parts of\\nthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part of\\nwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the\\nanus are harmless in their early stages but may later\\ndevelop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example, con-\\ntain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.\\nTypes of anal cancer include:\\n• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of\\nanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise\\nfrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.\\nThe anal margin is the part of the anus that is half inside\\nand half outside the body, and the anal canal is the part\\nof the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma in\\nsitu, or Bowen’s disease.\\n• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to\\none-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.\\nThese tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-\\nca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal and\\nthe rectum.\\n• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-\\nnocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. One\\ntype of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal area\\nis called Paget’s disease, which can also affect the\\nvulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.\\n• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are\\neither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,\\ntwo types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, which\\ndevelop from skin cells that produce the brown pigment\\ncalled melanin, are far more common on areas of the\\nbody exposed to the sun.\\nApproximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed\\nwith anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-\\nals will die of the disease during this same interval,\\naccording to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancers\\nare fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancers\\naffecting the digestive system. The disease affects\\nwomen somewhat more often than men, although the\\nnumber of cases among men, particularly homosexual\\nmen, seems to be increasing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,\\nalthough certain individuals appear to have a higher risk\\nof developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, as\\nare individuals with certain types of the human papillo-\\nmavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems in\\nthe anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-\\nlas. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-\\ntice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of anal\\ncancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex are\\nabout 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-\\nerosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,\\nsuch individuals with HIV , or transplant patients taking\\nimmunosuppressant drugs , are also at higher risk.\\nMost individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.\\nSymptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in\\nother harmless conditions. They include pain, itching\\nand bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,\\nchange in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the\\nstool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodes\\nin the anal or groin area.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine\\nphysicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoid\\nremoval. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal\\nexamination (DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,\\nlubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.\\nIndividuals over the age of 50 who have no symptoms\\nshould have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  five\\nto 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)\\nguidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.\\nOther diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:\\nAnoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a special\\ndevice to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure that\\ninvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-\\nsrectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves are\\nused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.\\nA biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;\\nthat is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a\\nmicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-\\nform a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,\\nin which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymph\\nnodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancer\\nhasn’t spread to these nodes.\\nAnal cancer severity is categorized by the following\\nstages:\\n• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of\\nanal tissue.\\n• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of\\nanal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2170\\nAnal cancer\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170'),\n",

The\\nmain drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-\\nFU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin.

They can be yellow, pink, or light\\nbrown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-\\nable. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware that\\nthey exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.\\nMost individuals have between one to 10 genital\\nwarts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm\\n2\\n. Some\\nwill complain of painless bumps or itching , but often,\\nthese warts can remain completely unnoticed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCondyloma acuminatum is one of the most common\\nsexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.\\nYoung adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.\\nRisk factors include smoking , using oral contracep-\\ntives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital\\nage. In addition, individuals who have a history of\\nimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.\\nRoughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the\\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which are\\nthe least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-\\ncerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through direct\\nsexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-\\nloma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, including\\nthe penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly\\n75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-\\none infected with condyloma acuminata will develop\\nthese warts within three months.\\nTreatment\\nAccording to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-\\nease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,\\nincluding anal warts, should be conducted according to\\nthe methods preferred by the patient, the medications or\\nprocedures most readily available, and the experience of\\nthe patient’s physician in removing anal warts.\\nTreatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-\\ncal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the anal\\ncanal will almost always be treated with cauterization or\\nsurgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-\\nsion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrence\\nrates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure rates\\nrange from 63–91%.\\nUnfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-\\nments because the virus that causes the warts can live in\\nthe surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal and\\nwart-free for six months or longer before another wart\\ndevelops.\\nLaser surgery is another possibility, but requires\\nlocal, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on the\\nnumber warts and where they are.\\nElectrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful of\\nthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminata\\nof the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It is\\ndone with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge or\\nbleeding from the anus.\\nFollow-up visits to the physician are necessary to\\nmake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-\\nmended that these patients see their physicians every\\nthree to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how long\\nthe incubation period is for the HPV virus.\\nCarbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-\\ntion are other options, but these are usually reserved for\\nextensive warts or those that continue to recur despite\\nnumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can\\nbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,\\nthey are usually reserved for the worst infections.\\nFor small warts that affect only the skin around the\\nanus, several medications are available, which can be\\napplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physician\\nor by the patients themselves.\\nSuch medications include podophyllum resin\\n(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from the\\ncytotoxic extracts of several plants.

It can be applied twice\\ndaily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly higher\\ncure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre-\\nvent warts.\\nTrichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-\\nable in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-\\nment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau-\\nterize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, they\\ncause less irritation and overall body effects than the\\nother agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, is\\nhigher with these acids.\\nBleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option,\\nbut it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis-\\ntered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but is\\ncan have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol-\\nlowed carefully by their physician.\\nImiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients to\\napply themselves.

Unfortunately, many cases of anal warts\\neither fail to respond to treatment or recur.

Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-\\ndepressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,\\nhave been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic\\npain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-\\ngesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on\\ncausation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of\\ntheir dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.\\nDescription\\nPain has been classified as “productive” pain and\\n“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has no\\nphysiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-\\nment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warning\\nof injury, and so may be both an indication of need for\\ntreatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”\\npain by definition serves no purpose either as a warning\\nor diagnostic tool.\\nAlthough pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the\\ncommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affected\\norgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the\\nnerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheral\\nnervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by the\\ncentral nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-\\ngesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors\\nof each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity of\\npain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain has\\nbeen divided into two classes, acute and chronic,\\nalthough severity and projected patient survival are other\\nfactors that must be considered in drug selection.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes\\npost-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth .\\nBecause pain of these types is expected to be short term,\\nthe long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-\\ntinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely be\\ntreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for their\\naddictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concern\\nfor their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should be\\nadjusted based on observation of healing rate, switching\\npatients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-\\ngesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.\\nAn important consideration of pain management in\\nsevere pain is that patients should not be subject to the\\nreturn of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately to\\nassure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequently\\nenough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici-\\npated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed on\\na “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered often\\nenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This\\napplies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.\\nChronic pain\\nChronic pain, pain lasting over three months and\\nsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult to\\ntreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics\\nare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-\\ngesics this means the addiction potential, as well as res-\\npiratory depression and constipation . For the NSAIDs,\\nthe risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. While\\nsome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-\\nonist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,\\nand the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-\\ncoxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,\\nthey are still not fully suitable for long-term management\\nof severe pain. Generally, chronic pain management\\nrequires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-\\ncation, and other treatment modalities.\\nNarcotic analgesics\\nThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all\\nderived from opium. The class includes morphine,\\ncodeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including\\nmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-\\ners. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all are\\neffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-\\nquate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Because\\nthese drugs are all addictive, they are controlled under\\nfederal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms are\\navailable, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous and\\nintrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.\\nNSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are\\neffective analgesics even at doses too low to have any\\nanti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-\\ncal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects and\\nside effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-\\ntration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate for\\ninjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain for\\nshort periods.\\nAcetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no\\nanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild to\\nmoderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-\\nmal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.\\nBecause acetaminophen is largely free of side effects at\\ntherapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choice\\nfor mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAppropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-\\nsider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2174\\nAnalgesics\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174'),\n",

Unlike other allergic\\nreactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction may\\nbegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, and\\nrapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin and\\nintestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severe\\ncases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,\\nshock, and death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nLike the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-\\nlaxis is caused by the release of histamine and other\\nchemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of white\\nblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-\\nsues that regulate exchange with the environment: the\\nairways, digestive system, and skin.\\nOn their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies\\ncalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies\\nare designed to detect environmental substances to\\nwhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances from\\na genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria or\\nviruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-\\nple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergic\\nresponse, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodies\\nbind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to release\\nhistamine and other chemicals, which spill out onto\\nneighboring cells.\\nThe interaction of these chemicals with receptors on\\nthe surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leak\\nfluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-\\ntion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cells\\nof the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-\\ntion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity and\\ncause itching.\\nIn anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to\\nextreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually\\nsystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause\\nanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-\\nlatory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-\\ntion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-\\nlaxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over time\\nfrom less severe allergies.\\nAnaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,\\ndrugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:\\n• fish, shellfish, and mollusks\\n• nuts and seeds\\n• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets\\n• papain from meat tenderizers\\n• vaccines, including flu and measles vaccines\\n• penicillin\\n• cephalosporins\\n• streptomycin\\n• gamma globulin\\n• insulin\\n• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)\\n• aspirin and other NSAIDs\\n• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for example\\nExposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis\\nin some individuals.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms may include:\\n• urticaria (hives)\\n• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth\\n• swelling of the sinuses\\n• difficulty breathing\\n• wheezing\\n• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea\\n• anxiety or confusion\\n• strong, very rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\\n• loss of consciousness\\nNot all symptoms may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-\\nopment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.\\nIdentification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-\\ning, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specific\\nallergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-\\nphylactic reactions.\\nTreatment\\nEmergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-\\ntion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts blood\\nvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygen\\nmay be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.\\nAntihistamines may be used for skin rash, and amino-\\nphylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway is\\nobstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-\\nmy tube may be needed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 179\\nAnaphylaxis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179'),\n",

Red blood cells, which contain\\nhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughout\\nthe body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, the\\niron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and used\\nto create new red blood cells. Anemia develops when\\nheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-\\nthing happens to slow down the production of red blood\\ncells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.\\nTypes of anemia\\nAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to\\nlead to life-threatening complications. More than 400\\ndifferent types of anemia have been identified. Many of\\nthem are rare.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-\\nmia is the most common form of anemia in the world. In\\nthe United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about\\n240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and\\n3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition is\\nless common in older children and in adults over 50 and\\nrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.\\nThe onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,\\nat first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiency\\nbegins when the body loses more iron than it derives\\nfrom food and other sources. Because depleted iron\\nstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer red\\nblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the red\\nblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.\\nThen the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiency\\nby producing more red blood cells, which are character-\\nistically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.\\nFOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-\\nciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas-\\ntic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-\\nmal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, a vitamin\\nthat the body needs to produce normal cells.\\nFolic acid anemia is especially common in infants\\nand teenagers. Although this condition usually results\\nfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inability\\nto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2180\\nAnemias\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180'),\n",

Folic acid anemia can be\\na complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s body\\nneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.\\nVITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in\\nthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B 12 deficien-\\ncy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia that\\ndevelops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of this\\nnutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B\\n12\\nis found in meat and vegetables.\\nLarge amounts of B 12 are stored in the body, so this\\ncondition may not become apparent until as much as four\\nyears after B\\n12 absorption stops or slows down. The\\nresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n• loss of muscle control\\n• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n• soreness or burning of the tongue\\n• weight loss\\n• yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B 12 deficiency is perni-\\ncious anemia . Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12 in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin\\nusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.\\nThis can occur among people who have had intestinal\\nsurgery or among those who do not produce adequate\\namounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by the\\nstomach lining that combines with B\\n12 to help its absorp-\\ntion in the small intestine.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages\\nof 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-\\nes the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:\\n• diabetes mellitus\\n• gastritis, stomach cancer, or stomach surgery\\n• thyroid disease\\n• family history of pernicious anemia\\nVITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder\\nthat causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormally\\nsmall red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia\\nresults from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with\\nhemolytic anemia . Some acquire this condition, in\\nwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells\\nmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-\\ning the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Other\\ncomplications of hemolytic anemia include:\\n• pain\\n• shock\\n• gallstones and other serious health problems\\nTHALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic\\nanemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability to\\nmanufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.\\nThere are two categories of thalassemia, depending on\\nwhich of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobin\\nis composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-\\nlassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of the\\nalpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there is\\nan imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most\\ncommonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);\\nbeta-thalassemias most commonly affect people of\\nMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.\\nCharacterized by production of red blood cells that\\nare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affects\\npeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-\\nsomal recessive inheritance).\\nAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-\\nbody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of this\\ndisorder. This condition occurs when the body produces\\nautoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cells\\nare destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common\\nin women than in men. About one-third of patients who\\nhave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-\\nphoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks\\nred blood cells at or below normal body temperature. The\\nacute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-\\nple who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or other\\nacute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, and\\ndisappears without treatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who are\\nover 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usually\\nlasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.\\nHowever, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 181\\nAnemias\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181'),\n",

Sickle cell anemia is a chron-\\nic, incurable condition that causes the body to produce\\ndefective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells to\\nassume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal oval\\ncells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobin\\nto nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes it\\nhard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-\\nsels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-\\ning condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.\\nSickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always\\naffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A\\nchild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent\\nwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cell\\ngene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, but\\ndoes not have the disease.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone\\nmarrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia\\nis characterized by decreased production of red and\\nwhite blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells that\\nallow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inherited\\nor acquired as a result of:\\n• recent severe illness\\n• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals\\n• use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic\\ninfection or inflammation, and kidney and liver disease\\noften cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-\\nure generally produces the most severe symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood\\ncell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.\\nPoor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and iron\\ndeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells are\\nproduced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases can\\ncause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-\\nsive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, and\\nthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significant\\neffect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss is\\nusually a consequence of:\\n• cancer\\n• gastrointestinal tumors\\n• diverticulosis\\n• polyposis\\n• heavy menstrual flow\\n• hemorrhoids\\n• nosebleeds\\n• stomach ulcers\\n• long-standing alcohol abuse\\nAcute blood loss is usually the result of:\\n• childbirth\\n• injury\\n• a ruptured blood vessel\\n• surgery\\nWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood\\npressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-\\ndenly. Heart failure and death can follow.\\nLoss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in\\nthe space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual blood\\nloss is less serious, because the body has time to create\\nnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.\\nSymptoms\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lack\\nof color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, or\\nlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someone\\nwho is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feels\\nfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic.\\nOther symptoms of anemia are:\\n• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a\\nchoking sensation that provokes severe anxiety)\\n• cravings for ice, paint, or dirt\\n• headache\\n• inability to concentrate, memory loss\\n• inflammation of the mouth ( stomatitis ) or tongue\\n(glossitis)\\n• insomnia\\n• irregular heartbeat\\n• loss of appetite\\n• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged\\n• rapid breathing\\n• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum\\n• sweating\\n• swelling of the hands and feet\\n• thirst\\n• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\\n• unexplained bleeding or bruising\\nIn pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually\\nslick.

Transfusions of red blood cells\\nmay be used to accelerate production of red blood cells.\\nMedication or surgery may also be necessary to con-\\ntrol heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer, or\\nremove polyps (growths or nodules) from the bowels.\\nPatients with thalassemia usually do not require\\ntreatment. However people with a severe form may\\nrequire periodic hospitalization for blood transfusions\\nand/or bone marrow transplantation.\\nSICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Treatment for sickle cell ane-\\nmia involves regular eye examinations, immunizations\\nfor pneumonia and infectious diseases, and prompt treat-\\nment for sickle cell crises and infections of any kind.\\nPsychotherapy or counseling may help patients deal with\\nthe emotional impact of this condition.\\nVITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A life-long regi-\\nmen of B12 shots is necessary to control symptoms of per-\\nnicious anemia. The patient may be advised to limit phys-\\nical activity until treatment restores strength and balance.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. People who have aplastic ane-\\nmia are especially susceptible to infection. Treatment for\\naplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bone\\nmarrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells with\\nhealthy ones.\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specific\\ntreatment for anemia associated with chronic disease, but\\ntreating the underlying illness may alleviate this condi-\\ntion. This type of anemia rarely becomes severe. If it\\ndoes, transfusions or hormone treatments to stimulate red\\nblood cell production may be prescribed.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. There is no specific treatment\\nfor cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About one-third of\\npatients with warm-antibody hemolytic anemia respond\\nwell to large doses of intravenous and oral corticos-\\nteroids, which are gradually discontinued as the patient’s\\ncondition improves. Patients with this condition who\\ndon’t respond to medical therapy must have the spleen\\nsurgically removed. This operation controls anemia in\\nabout half of the patients on whom it’s performed.\\nImmune-system suppressants are prescribed for patients\\nwhose surgery is not successful.\\nSelf-care\\nAnyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition\\nshould modify his or her diet to include more vitamins,\\nminerals, and iron. Vitamin C can stimulate iron absorp-\\ntion.

If the cause is a deficiency,\\nfor example iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, B\\n12\\ndeficiency, or vitamin C deficiency, supplementation is\\nthe treatment. For extensive blood loss, the cause should\\nbe identified and corrected. Other types of anemias\\nshould be addressed on a deep healing level with crisis\\nintervention when necessary.\\nMany alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane-\\nmia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or on\\ntechniques to improve circulation and digestion. Iron\\nsupplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likely\\nto cause constipation), is used by alternative practition-\\ners. This can be given in combination with herbs that are\\nrich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-\\nlion ( Taraxacum officinale ), parsley ( Petroselinum\\ncrispum ), and nettle ( Urtica dioica ). The homeopathic\\nremedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.\\nAn iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using\\nthe following recipe:\\n• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion\\nroot in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours\\n• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced\\nto 1 cup\\n• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,\\nmixing well\\n• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily\\nOther herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency\\nanemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian ( Gentiana\\nlutea) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other\\nnutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-\\ntian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and\\nother nutrients more available for absorption. This bitter\\nherb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholic\\nextract (tincture).\\nOther herbs recommended to promote digestion\\ninclude:\\n• anise (Pimpinella anisum)\\n• caraway (Carum carvi)\\n• cumin (Cuminum cyminum)\\n• linden (Tilia spp.)\\n• licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\\nTraditional Chinese treatments for anemia include:\\n• acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen\\n• asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) to restore energy\\n• dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ) to control heavy men-\\nstrual bleeding\\n• a mixture of dong quai and Chinese foxglove(Rehman-\\nnia glutinosa) to clear a sallow complexion\\nPrognosis\\nFolic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias\\nIt usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic\\nacid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continue\\ntaking supplements for another six months to replenish\\niron reserves and should have periodic blood tests to\\nmake sure the bleeding has stopped and the anemia has\\nnot recurred.\\nPernicious anemia\\nAlthough pernicious anemia is considered incurable,\\nregular B\\n12 shots will alleviate symptoms and reverse\\ncomplications. Some symptoms will disappear almost as\\nsoon as treatment begins.\\nAplastic anemia\\nAplastic anemia can sometimes be cured by bone\\nmarrow transplantation.

The patient experiences analge-\\nsia or a loss of pain sensation but remains conscious\\nand can carry on a conversation.\\n• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience\\ndelirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and\\nbecomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. This\\nstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-\\nrate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.\\n• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the\\nskeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathing\\nbecomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, and\\nsurgery can begin.\\n• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis . This stage occurs if\\nthe respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of the\\nbrain that control breathing and other vital functions\\ncease to function. Death can result if the patient cannot\\nbe revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.\\nCareful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-\\ntered prevent this occurrence.\\nAgents used for general anesthesia may be either\\ngases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaled\\nwith oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-\\nnation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugs\\nare usually delivered during general anesthesia; this\\npractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used because\\nit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-\\nthetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, the\\nextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a general\\nanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-\\ncentration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathed\\nby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by an\\nintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot be\\nchanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-\\nthetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia and\\nthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.\\nGeneral anesthesia works by altering the flow of\\nsodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through the\\ncell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is\\nnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind to\\nany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem to\\naffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve\\nimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is\\nknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do not\\nget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generated\\nand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-\\nories, does not register pain impulses from other areas of\\nthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.\\nAlthough anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not the\\nsame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up while\\nothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-\\nsciousness is more widespread.\\nWhen general anesthesia was first introduced in\\nmedical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled with\\nthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.\\nSince then, general anesthesia has become much more\\nsophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-\\nic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-\\nized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoring\\nas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-\\ngists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery of\\nanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-\\nthetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-\\nrane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\\n• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can\\neasily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-\\nsciousness but little pain relief so it is often used with\\nother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxic\\nto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has the\\npotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.\\nHalothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently the\\nanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since the\\nintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothane\\nuse has declined.\\n• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a\\nmore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening\\nthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of\\nparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to\\nincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;\\ntherefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with\\nseizure disorders.\\n• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can\\ncause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often\\nused in combination with intravenous anesthetics for\\nanesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is\\nfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.\\n• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and\\nshould not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-\\nsis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-\\nmias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation\\nduring induction and is therefore used with intravenous\\nanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-\\nnated and awakening is therefore faster than with other\\ninhaled agents.\\n• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart\\nrate and should not be used in patients with narrowed\\naortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usually\\ncause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-\\nrane does not cause any coughing or other related side\\neffects, and can therefore be used without intravenous\\nagents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluorane\\nis replacing halothane for induction in pediatric\\npatients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-\\nnated and allows rapid awakening.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2186\\nAnesthesia, general\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 186')]"
